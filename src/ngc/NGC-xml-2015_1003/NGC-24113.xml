Overall, the search strategies employed for each of the sections of the submission were appropriate. A detailed commentary of the search strategies employed is given in Appendix 1 of the ERG report.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Statement of the Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria Used in the Study Selection and Comment on Whether They Were Appropriate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Within the submission, the trials of dronedarone are presented separately from the review of dronedarone and comparators. The detailed presentation of the dronedarone trials focuses on 4 phase III randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of dronedarone (EURIDIS/ADONIS, ATHENA and DIONYSOS). These four trials are in the licensed indication and provide data on the efficacy and safety of dronedarone. Additionally, one phase II dose ranging study (DAFNE) and one phase III trial of dronedarone in patients with permanent AF (ERATO), which are not discussed in detail in the submission, provide data on treatment discontinuations and safety of dronedarone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The comparative review of dronedarone and other&amp;nbsp;anti-arrhythmic drugs (AADs) presented in the submission is based on a broader systematic review and meta-analysis commissioned by the manufacturer. This broader review encompassed class 1a, class 1c, class III, class II, class IV drugs and digoxin, and ablation. Within this broader review, dronedarone, amiodarone, sotalol, flecainide and propafenone were identified as 'priority drugs' and the review was based on 72 RCTs that involved at least one priority drug treatment arm. Although this is not clearly stated in the submission, only comparisons of these priority drugs with a non-active control or another priority drug were included in the meta-analysis presented in the submission (a total of 39 trials). Thus, only trials of dronedarone, amiodarone, sotalol, flecainide and propafenone versus placebo, no treatment, or each other are included.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The manufacturer's submission states that the systematic review of clinical effectiveness included RCTs and controlled trials, although the systematic review submitted as supplementary material to the ERG itself states that only RCTs were included.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Outcomes of interest included mortality, stroke, AF recurrence, treatment withdrawals (due to any cause and due to adverse effects) and serious adverse effects (SAEs).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The intervention criteria were appropriate given current NICE guidelines for the treatment of AF. The use of data from RCTs only was appropriate as this is likely to provide the most reliable estimates of efficacy and safety. However, the inclusion of participants with any type of AF was inappropriate given that the anticipated licensed indication for dronedarone was for non-permanent AF, i.e., paroxysmal and persistent AF, rather than permanent AF. The omission of health-related quality of life as an outcome deviates from the inclusion criteria stipulated in systematic review protocol, and the appraisal scope.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economic Evaluation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The search strategy was described in the manufacturer's submission to identify published cost-effectiveness studies for dronedarone and for the comparators (amiodarone, sotalol and class 1c). The manufacturer searched a variety of electronic databases including Medline, Medline (R) In Process, Embase, Health Economic Evaluation Database and the National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A total of 15 studies were considered to be eligible for the systematic review. However, all 15 studies evaluated the cost-effectiveness of the comparator treatment and no cost-effectiveness studies of dronedarone were identified. The manufacturer did not consider these studies to be directly relevant to the decision problem, and no further details of these were reported in the main submission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="136" OrdBy="415" ID="408" Name="Number of Source Documents" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Effectiveness&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A total of 39 publications that reported data from 6 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were used in the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost-Effectiveness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;No cost-effectiveness studies of dronedarone were identified. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The manufacturer submitted an economic model. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="115" OrdBy="420" ID="409" Name="Methods Used to Assess the Quality and Strength of the Evidence" Type="picklist-choice"><FieldValue Value="Expert Consensus" /></Field><Field FieldID="149" OrdBy="425" ID="410" Name="Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not applicable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="116" OrdBy="430" ID="411" Name="Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence" Type="picklist-many"><FieldValue Value="Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials" /><FieldValue Value="Systematic Review with Evidence Tables" /></Field><Field FieldID="150" OrdBy="435" ID="412" Name="Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)&lt;/strong&gt;: The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) commissioned an independent academic centre to perform a systematic literature review on the technology considered in this appraisal and prepare an Evidence Review Group (ERG) report.

However, neither the manufacturer's submission nor the supporting systematic review provides any details of the validity assessment of the included RCTs, or utilises study validity in their analyses. Whilst data from RCTs can represent the best available evidence, the absence of a validity assessment means that it is not possible to determine the reliability of the data used in the analyses. In particular, in this submission, the lack of information on the comparator trials makes a lack of a quality assessment particularly important. This is because the quality of the trials should be considered when deciding whether they can be combined in a meta-analysis or mixed treatment comparison (MTC).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Describe and Critique the Statistical Approach Used&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;RCTs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The methods of analysis for the dronedarone trials are generally good. In most cases appropriate intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis was used. A number of post-hoc analyses of additional outcomes and subgroups from the ATHENA trial were reported.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The methods of analysis used in the comparator trials cannot be commented upon, as no details were supplied in the submission or the supporting systematic review.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Direct and Indirect Comparisons&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The methods of the direct and indirect statistical (meta) analysis are not reported in the manufacturer's submission but are detailed in the supporting systematic review. However, it should be noted that the methods were not previously specified in the systematic review protocol.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MTC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No details of the methods used to perform the MTC analysis were included in the submission. The full report supplied on request by the manufacturer contained only limited details of the methods. Some further limited information was supplied by the company upon further request regarding issues of model convergence and a new methods section, which better explained the difference between the methods used and Bayesian methods utilising WinBUGs methods.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When interpreting the results from any MTC, it is crucial to understand the network of trials that were included. Although the data included in the final MTC analyses were supplied to the ERG, and the ERG were able to construct network diagrams for each outcome, not all trials comprising the data set for each outcome were included in the MTC.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critique of Submitted Evidence Syntheses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Results are presented for atrial fibrillation (AF) recurrence, all-cause mortality, treatment discontinuation (any cause), treatment discontinuation (adverse effects [AEs]), and stroke.

The manufacturer notes that this position is referred to within current UK guidelines as 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; line treatment. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To establish the cost-effectiveness in these two separate clinical positions, dronedarone was compared with a range of alternative therapeutic options (including standard care, class 1c, sotalol and amiodarone). The choice of comparator was dependent upon both the clinical position, the clinical AF type, and baseline risk factors in line with clinical guidelines and are outlined schematically in the manufacturer's submission.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A model-based cost utility analysis was carried out using discrete event simulation (DES). The model includes four main health states (normal sinus rhythm, permanent atrial fibrillation with uncontrolled symptoms, permanent atrial fibrillation with controlled symptoms, and death). Movements between these main health states were driven by events. A total of seven events were included (AF recurrence, acute coronary syndrome [ACS], stroke, congestive heart failure [CHF], treatment discontinuation for any cause, AF symptoms change for permanent patient and death) to capture the range of possible clinical pathways for the patient population.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Patients were stratified in the model according to their clinical AF type and the baseline risk factors in line with UK guidelines. Five main patient groups were considered:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Paroxysmal AF patients with no structural heart disease &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Paroxysmal AF patients with coronary heart disease &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Paroxysmal AF patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Persistent AF patients with no structural heart disease &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Persistent AF patients with structural heart disease &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition to these main groups of patients, a range of additional subgroup analyses were also performed in the economic evaluation including: age, CHADS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; score, and gender. The choice of subgroups was considered by the manufacturer to be the most clinically relevant groups to be analysed in accordance with the approach employed in current UK clinical guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sensitivity Analysis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Both univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were undertaken by the manufacturer. A full list of parameters (and their associated distributions) included in the PSA are reported in the manufacturer's submission. The main sources of parameter uncertainty considered in the PSA were: (1) the time to event equations, (2) treatment effect estimates, (3) the increased risk of all-cause mortality due to CHADS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, (4) post-stoke mortality, (5) utilities assigned to the main events and (6) costs (AF hospitalisation, ablation and initiation costs).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A detailed series of univariate sensitivity analyses were also undertaken to explore a range of alternative scenarios. These are summarised in Table 18 of the ERG report.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Refer to Section 5 of the ERG report for additional information on the economic analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="112" OrdBy="440" ID="413" Name="Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations" Type="picklist-choice"><FieldValue Value="Expert Consensus" /></Field><Field FieldID="145" OrdBy="445" ID="414" Name="Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Considerations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Technology appraisal recommendations are based on a review of clinical and economic evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technology Appraisal Process&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) invites 'consultee' and 'commentator' organisations to take part in the appraisal process. Consultee organisations include national groups representing patients and carers, the bodies representing health professionals, and the manufacturers of the technology under review. Consultees are invited to submit evidence during the appraisal and to comment on the appraisal documents.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Commentator organisations include manufacturers of the products with which the technology is being compared, the National Health Service (NHS) Quality Improvement Scotland and research groups working in the area. They can comment on the evidence and other documents but are not asked to submit evidence themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;NICE then commissions an independent academic centre to review published evidence on the technology and prepare an 'assessment report'. Consultees and commentators are invited to comment on the report. The assessment report and the comments on it are then drawn together in a document called the evaluation report.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An independent Appraisal Committee then considers the evaluation report. It holds a meeting where it hears direct, spoken evidence from nominated clinical experts, patients and carers. The Committee uses all the evidence to make its first recommendations, in a document called the 'appraisal consultation document' (ACD). NICE sends all the consultees and commentators a copy of this document and posts it on the NICE website. Further comments are invited from everyone taking part.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the Committee meets again it considers any comments submitted on the ACD; then it prepares its final recommendations in a document called the 'final appraisal determination' (FAD). This is submitted to NICE for approval.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Consultees have a chance to appeal against the final recommendations in the FAD. If there are no appeals, the final recommendations become the basis of the guidance that NICE issues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who Is on the Appraisal Committee?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;NICE technology appraisal recommendations are prepared by an independent committee. This includes health professionals working in the NHS and people who are familiar with the issues affecting patients and carers. Although the Appraisal Committee seeks the views of organisations representing health professionals, patients, carers, manufacturers and government, its advice is independent of any vested interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="146" OrdBy="450" ID="415" Name="Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not applicable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="148" OrdBy="460" ID="417" Name="Cost Analysis" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model used in the manufacturer's cost-effectiveness analysis was a discrete event simulation that predicts a person's course if they are treated with dronedarone compared with the predicted course with alternative treatment pathways. The manufacturer stratified people depending on their type of atrial fibrillation and baseline risk factors into five groups in accordance with the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidance on atrial fibrillation (NICE clinical guideline 36): paroxysmal atrial fibrillation without structural heart disease, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with coronary heart disease, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with left ventricular dysfunction, persistent atrial fibrillation without structural heart disease, and persistent atrial fibrillation with structural heart disease. For each of these subgroups, the manufacturer evaluated the cost-effectiveness of dronedarone at two positions in the care pathway for atrial fibrillation. When dronedarone was evaluated as part of a first-line treatment for people with a&amp;nbsp;clinical prediction rule for estimating risk of stroke in patients with AF (CHADS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) score of 4 or more (in addition to standard baseline therapy), the comparator was standard baseline therapy alone (including beta-blockers [excluding sotalol] and anticoagulation). When dronedarone was evaluated as a second-line treatment option, the comparators were the antiarrhythmic drugs amiodarone, sotalol and class 1c drugs, depending on the type of atrial fibrillation and baseline risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Committee discussed the cost-effectiveness of dronedarone as a first-line treatment for atrial fibrillation (in addition to standard baseline therapy usually including beta-blockers). It noted that cost-effectiveness evidence for dronedarone as a first-line therapy had only been provided for the subgroup of people with a CHADS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; score of 4 or more. In addition to concerns about the validity of the CHADS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; score in this context, the Committee considered that the beneficial effect of dronedarone on all-cause mortality assumed in the manufacturer's submission was not proven. It noted that when this effect was removed from the economic analysis, the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained was above &amp;pound;50,000. The Committee concluded that the use of dronedarone in people with a CHADS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; score of 4 or more (in addition to standard baseline therapy) for the first-line treatment of atrial fibrillation could not be considered a cost-effective use of National Health Service (NHS) resources.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Committee discussed the cost-effectiveness of dronedarone as a second-line treatment for people whose atrial fibrillation is not controlled by standard baseline therapy (that is, as an alternative to the antiarrhythmic drugs: amiodarone, sotalol and class 1c agents).
