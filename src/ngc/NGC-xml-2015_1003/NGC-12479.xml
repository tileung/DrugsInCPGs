However, in general:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Review 1&lt;/em&gt; included: systematic reviews from 1990 onwards, RCTs from 1990 onwards published worldwide in English and non-randomised studies (cohorts, qualitative studies and surveys) conducted from 1990 and published in the UK. It focused on interventions for non-pregnant women of childbearing age who were planning a pregnancy or who might become pregnant. The interventions had to start prior to conception but could continue or stop at any time during the pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Review 2&lt;/em&gt; included: systematic reviews published since 1995; RCTs from 1990 onwards published worldwide in English and non-randomised UK studies from 1990 onwards, with a particular focus on nutrition interventions aimed at low-income women during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Review 3&lt;/em&gt; included: systematic reviews from 1995 onwards, RCTs from 1990 onwards published worldwide in English, and UK studies of all interventions aiming to improve the nutrition of women during the first year after birth. Studies had to examine women up to 6 weeks after giving birth (postpartum) and living in developed countries, from any socio-economic background. Where data were available, the review also considered interventions on disadvantaged population subgroups.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Review 4&lt;/em&gt; included: systematic reviews from 1995 onwards, RCTs from 1990 onwards published worldwide in English, and other UK studies.

It focused on interventions to promote safe and healthy feeding practices for infants and young children who are moving from an exclusively milk-based diet to solid food.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Review 6&lt;/em&gt; included: systematic reviews from 1995 onwards published worldwide in English, RCTs from 1990 onwards conducted in developed countries, and other study types conducted in the UK and published from 1990 onwards. It focused on interventions aimed at children aged 2 to 5 years old, their parents and carers, and staff looking after 2 to 5 year olds in nurseries and other day care settings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Review 7&lt;/em&gt; included: all types of studies conducted in the UK, and systematic reviews and RCTs carried out in developed countries. Only papers published in English between 1966 and 2006 were considered. It focused on interventions promoting vitamin D intake, in line with the Committee on Medical Aspects of Food and Nutrition Policy (COMA) recommendations on vitamin D. The interventions had to be aimed at one of the following:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Women who were planning a pregnancy, were pregnant or had given birth in the previous year &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Infants and young children (from birth up to age 5 years) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Vulnerable groups (with a particular emphasis on black and minority ethnic groups) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Review 8&lt;/em&gt; included: primary studies (cohort and case-control studies, case-series and expert opinions). It focused on corroborative evidence on interventions to improve the nutrition of infants/children aged 6 months to 5 years. (The corroborative evidence related to the process and context of interventions.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Economic Appraisal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The economic appraisal consisted of two economic effectiveness reviews and an economic appraisal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reviews of Economic Evaluation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The following databases were searched: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, CCTR, CDSR, DARE and NHSEED. The search strategy combined relevant terms relating to:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Pre-conceptual, pregnant and postpartum women &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Children up to age 5 years &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The search incorporated a sensitive health economics filter and focused on interventions rather than being restricted to outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In selecting studies for the review, the main exclusion criteria were as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Primary studies set in developing or low-income countries &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Studies published before 1990 &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Papers in a language other than English &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Papers not held at the British Library &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Abstracts &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Currency Review&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) undertook a review of this guideline in 2011 and determined that the information is current.

It uses the literature to derive assumptions about the relationship between breastfeeding and health outcomes and, in particular, the &amp;quot;downstream costs&amp;quot; of those outcomes. It then explores the cost-effectiveness of interventions by developing &amp;quot;what if scenarios&amp;quot; for a given cost of intervention, population size and estimated impact of the intervention on breastfeeding initiation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With baseline data and assumptions the model suggests that an investment of 20,000 pounds sterling in a peer support scheme of this type produces net societal savings of 5,500 pounds sterling, after &amp;quot;downstream savings&amp;quot; from increased breastfeeding initiation and duration are taken into account. In addition the model suggests that the scheme would avert 0.057 cases of pre-menopausal breast cancer in mothers (2.7 cases per 10,000) and almost 6 cases (285 cases per 10,000) of infections requiring hospitalisation in the first year of life. However, as the scheme is estimated to produce net cost-savings without considering these additional benefits, it is not necessary to convert the additional benefits to quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A scheme to increase breastfeeding, costing about 100 pounds sterling per mother, will break even in terms of lower feeding costs and reduced future hospital admissions if there is about a 20 percentage-point increase in initiation rates of breast-feeding. (This does not take account of lower rates of breast cancer of the mother, the trauma of hospitalisation of the infant, or the opportunity cost of the alternative use of scarce health-care resources.) For a 30 percentage point increase in initiation, the gain to society for each initiating mother is about 400 pounds sterling (about 125 pounds sterling averaged over all mothers) compared with the 100 pounds sterling cost per mother of the scheme. If the health gains for both mother and child are considered, a scheme costing 100 pounds sterling per mother and yielding breastfeeding initiation rate increases of a little less than 20 percentage points is likely to be cost effective.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Refer to 'Modelling the cost-effectiveness of breastfeeding support' document available on the NICE website at: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nice.org.uk/PH011&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;NICE Web site&quot;&gt;www.nice.org.uk/PH011&lt;/a&gt; for more information on cost analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rapid Economic Review of Public Health Interventions Designed to Improve the Nutrition of Pre-Conceptual, Pregnant, and Post Partum Women&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is recognized that that nutritional status before and during pregnancy, in the post partum period and breastfeeding, and in the early years of life is important to the short and long term health of the mother, the development of the foetus and as a foundation of health for the infants later life. However, there are concerns that nutritional status is sub-optimal, especially in lower socioeconomic groups.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The literature review suggested that there is a paucity of good quality economic studies on public health interventions of this type. Furthermore, much of what is published relates to a non-UK context and the conclusions of such studies may not be readily generalised to a different setting. The review also highlighted the methodological problem of assessing the cost-effectiveness of public health interventions which include some nutritional aspect as just one part of a bigger overall package. With such interventions it can be difficult to attribute the observed effects to each constituent part.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Notwithstanding these caveats, there is some evidence from outside the UK to support the cost-effectiveness of folic acid supplementation. However, there is little published data on the cost-effectiveness of different interventions to increase uptake of folic acid.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One study suggests that home-based nurse lactation consultants are more cost-effective than hospital-based lactation consultants in promoting breast feeding.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, evidence from the US indicates that the provision of supplemental food to low income pregnant, breast feeding and post partum women is cost-effective, especially in black women.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rapid Economic Review of Public Health Interventions Designed to Improve the Nutrition of Children aged 0-5 Years&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is recognized that that nutritional status is a foundation of health for the infant's later life.

It is estimated that if all UK infants were exclusively breastfed, the number hospitalised each month with diarrhoea would be halved, and the number hospitalised with a respiratory infection would be cut by a quarter.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Exclusive breastfeeding in the early months reduces the risk of atopic dermatitis. In addition, there is some evidence that babies who are not breastfed are more likely to become obese in later childhood.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Mothers who do not breastfeed have an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancers and may find it more difficult to return to their pre-pregnancy weight.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maternal, Infant and Child Nutrition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The importance of ensuring mothers and their babies are well-nourished is widely recognised. A pregnant woman's nutritional status influences the growth and development of her fetus and forms the foundations for the child's later health. The mother's own health, both in the short and long term, also depends on how well-nourished she is before, during and after pregnancy.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Women who may become pregnant can most easily reduce the risk of having a baby with a neural tube defect (for example, anencephaly and spina bifida) by taking folic acid supplements.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy will increase both the mother's and her baby's vitamin D stores and reduce the baby's risk of developing rickets.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If maternal vitamin supplements were also made available for women with a child between 1 and 4 years, the incidence of neural tube defects and prevalence of rickets could, potentially, be further reduced.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A child's diet during the early years also impacts on their growth and development. It is linked to the incidence of many common childhood conditions such as diarrhoeal disease, dental caries and iron and vitamin D deficiencies. It may also influence the risk in adult life of conditions such as coronary heart disease, diabetes and obesity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="153" OrdBy="710" ID="429" Name="Potential Harms" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not stated&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field></Section><Section SecID="432" OrdBy="900" Name="Qualifying Statements"><Field FieldID="137" OrdBy="905" ID="433" Name="Qualifying Statements" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This guidance represents the views of the Institute and was arrived at after careful consideration of the evidence available.
