See the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field for the full version of this guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The short clinical guideline process follows the standard process for identifying evidence (see Chapter 5 of 'The NICE guidelines manual 2009').&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See Appendix A of the original guideline document for review protocol and inclusion and exclusion criteria.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Information and Support&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A total of 6,183 articles were found by systematic searches, a further six systematic reviews were suggested by the Guideline Development Group (GDG) (four of which had not been identified in the searches and one further review was identified through background searching). Full text was ordered for 168 articles based on the title and abstract.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First Review Question&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thirteen papers met the eligibility criteria and described the experience of decision-making when starting dialysis. Although many studies reported factors associated with the choice of dialysis, they were excluded because the focus was the experience of the patient, family, or healthcare professional as explored using qualitative methods. However, some surveys evaluating patient-centred factors associated with the choice of dialysis are included because the GDG considered that they contributed important information.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second Review Question&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Two papers evaluated the effectiveness of interventions to improve decision-making when starting dialysis. Three studies did not meet the eligibility criteria and were not considered further. Although the systematic reviews looked at interventions to improve decisions throughout the patient journey of chronic kidney disease (CKD), only those studies that focused on choosing dialysis were considered for this review.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Modalities of Dialysis: Haemodialysis and Peritoneal Dialysis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A total of 5,149 articles were found by systematic searches. Full text was ordered for 320 articles (comparing peritoneal dialysis with any other type of dialysis, including haemodialysis) based on the title and abstract. Only one primary study met the eligibility criteria and evaluated the effectiveness of peritoneal dialysis compared with haemodialysis for adults with stage 5 CKD. A Cochrane systematic review was found that compared peritoneal dialysis with haemodialysis and this included the one study identified in the GDG's reviews, so only the results from the primary study are presented. No randomised controlled trial (RCT) evidence was found for children with stage 5 CKD.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because of the lack of RCT evidence, the GDG asked the technical team to search for publications from national renal registries that would provide further information on the outcomes agreed important for this guideline. Systematic searches for registry data reported in published articles found 1,672 articles. Full text was ordered for 261 articles based on the title and abstract. In addition, the GDG looked for annual reports for those not identified by the searches; this included the 2008 annual report of the North American Pediatric Renal Trials and Collaborative Studies. Of these publications, 53 papers met the eligibility criteria for registry publications; 42 evaluated the effectiveness of peritoneal dialysis or haemodialysis, either with comparative analyses or single intervention reports for adults and children. The GDG also re-checked studies identified for other questions (for example, switching) and included those that were relevant. Table 1 in the original guideline document summarises the included studies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of the 42 studies, 11 included children (31 were adults alone); 25 reported outcomes for both peritoneal dialysis and haemodialysis, with 14 on peritoneal dialysis alone and three on haemodialysis alone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health Economic Modelling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A search was made for any appropriate studies. Five studies were identified that were considered suitable. These are outlined in the Health Economic Appendix B of the original guideline document.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Modalities of Dialysis: Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis, Automated Peritoneal Dialysis, and Assisted Peritoneal Dialysis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A total of 5,149 articles were found by systematic searches. Full text was ordered for 320 articles (comparing peritoneal dialysis with any other modality of dialysis, including haemodialysis) based on the title and abstract. Only four papers from three studies met the eligibility criteria and evaluated the effectiveness of different types of peritoneal dialysis for stage 5 CKD. The same three studies were also included in a systematic review identified through the GDG's searches. No RCT evidence was found for children with stage 5 CKD.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because of the lack of RCT evidence, the GDG asked the technical team to search for publications from national renal registries that would provide further information on the outcomes considered important for this guideline. A total of 1,672 articles were found by systematic searches focused on the retrieval of registry data reported in published articles. Full text was ordered for 261 articles based on the title and abstract. In addition, the GDG looked for annual reports for those not identified through the searches; this included the 2008 North American Pediatric Renal Trials and Collaborative Studies annual report. Of these publications, 53 papers met the eligibility criteria for registry publications; 11 evaluated the effectiveness of different types of peritoneal dialysis, either with comparative analyses or single intervention reports for adults and children. The GDG also re-checked the studies identified for other questions (for example, switching) and included those that were relevant. Of these 11 studies, four included children (seven were adults alone); eight reported outcomes for both automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), two for CAPD alone and one for APD alone. Table 6 in the original guideline document summarises the included studies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Sequences of Treatment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A total of 1,669 articles were found by systematic searches. Full text papers were ordered for 50 articles (comparing sequences of treatment that include peritoneal dialysis) based on the title and abstract. Seven studies met the eligibility criteria and evaluated the effectiveness of treatment sequences that include peritoneal dialysis. Different sequences were compared in the published studies. Only one study included children.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for the other reviews of dialysis in this guideline, because of the lack of RCT evidence, the GDG included publications from national renal registries that would provide further information on the outcomes considered important for this guideline. The GDG also re-checked the studies identified for other questions (for example, effectiveness of peritoneal dialysis) and included those that were relevant.

Imprecision was rated as not relevant throughout because it does not apply to the type of evidence considered in this question. The following principles were applied to assess quality: a systematic review of qualitative studies started as high, and a single qualitative study started as moderate, with downgrading as appropriate. For the GRADE assessment, registry studies were assessed as low-quality evidence, with downgrading as appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Only the evidence considered to be directly relevant is summarised in the GRADE tables in the original guideline document.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="112" OrdBy="440" ID="413" Name="Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations" Type="picklist-choice"><FieldValue Value="Expert Consensus" /><FieldValue Value="Informal Consensus" /></Field><Field FieldID="145" OrdBy="445" ID="414" Name="Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)&lt;/strong&gt;: This guideline was developed by the Centre for Clinical Practice at the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE).

Each GDG has a Chair, healthcare professional members and a minimum of two patient and carer members. Co-opted expert advisers are recruited, as appropriate. A Clinical Adviser, who has specific content expertise and additional responsibilities, may also be appointed depending on the topic. Recruitment of the GDG Chair and members is carried out in accordance with NICE's policy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The GDG makes its decisions using the best available evidence presented to it at GDG meetings by the Short Clinical Guidelines Team. The use of formal consensus methods within the GDG will be considered on a case-by-case basis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developing Review Questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A short clinical guideline has a narrow scope and covers only part of a care pathway. It addresses a maximum of three subject areas covering clinical management. This will result in a small number of key clinical issues. These are broken down into a defined number of review questions &amp;mdash; usually one or two per clinical management area. The exact number will be dictated by the size of the short clinical guideline remit and the amount of development time available.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creating Guideline Recommendations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Explicit methods of linking the evidence to recommendations are used for short clinical guidelines if the topic is suitable. This involves using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Research recommendations are formulated for short clinical guidelines. Their number is dependent on the size of the short clinical guideline remit and the amount of development time available.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Writing the Guideline&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are usually three versions of short clinical guidelines:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The full guideline &amp;ndash; all the recommendations, details of how they were developed and summaries of the evidence they are based on. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The quick reference guide &amp;ndash; a summary of the recommendations for healthcare professionals. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;'Understanding NICE guidance' &amp;ndash; a summary for patients and carers &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The full guideline is written by the Short Clinical Guidelines Team, following the principles in Chapters 9 and 10 of 'The guidelines manual' (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="146" OrdBy="450" ID="415" Name="Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not applicable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="148" OrdBy="460" ID="417" Name="Cost Analysis" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cost effectiveness results presented in Appendix B of the full version of the original guideline indicate that increasing the use of peritoneal dialysis would be a cost effective and also cost saving policy for the National Health Service (NHS). However, the probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicates that there is still considerable uncertainty over the comparative clinical effectiveness of the two treatments. In addition, there are a number of limitations of this analysis that prevents its use in assessing the cost effectiveness of specific pathways and population groups.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, until further information becomes available peritoneal dialysis (PD) and haemodialysis (HD) should be allocated to those considered most likely to benefit. This means clinically and more importantly in terms of quality of life. This is because the main benefit of PD over HD is in terms of quality of life rather than a proven clinical benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally the major issue affecting renal replacement therapy (RRT) in the next couple of years will be the use of home HD which may become more accessible to patients as the equipment becomes easier to use and less expensive.
