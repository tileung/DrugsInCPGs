See the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field for the full version of this guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Systematic Clinical Literature Review&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The aim of the clinical literature review was to systematically identify and synthesise relevant evidence from the literature in order to answer the specific review questions developed by the guideline development group (GDG).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methodology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A stepwise, hierarchical approach was taken to locating and presenting evidence to the GDG. NCCMH developed this process based on methods set out by the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) (The Guidelines Manual, 2009), and after considering recommendations from a range of other sources. These included:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Clinical Policy and Practice Program of the New South Wales Department of Health (Australia) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;British Medical Journal (BMJ) Clinical Evidence &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Grading of Recommendations: Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;New Zealand Guidelines Group &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;National Health Service (NHS) Centre for Reviews and Dissemination &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Oxford Systematic Review Development Programme &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The Cochrane Collaboration &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Review Process&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scoping Searches&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A broad preliminary search of the literature was undertaken in October 2009 to obtain an overview of the issues likely to be covered by the scope, and to help define key areas. Searches were restricted to clinical guidelines, health technology assessment reports, key systematic reviews and randomised controlled trials (RCTs). See Section 3.5.2 in the full version of the guideline document for databases and websites searched.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Existing NICE guidelines were updated where necessary. Other relevant guidelines were assessed for quality using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) instrument. Where an individual review from another guideline was used (rather than the full guideline), the systematic review methodology checklist was used, rather than the AGREE instrument. The evidence base underlying high-quality existing guidelines was utilised and updated as appropriate. Further information about this process can be found in The Guidelines Manual (2009).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Systematic Literature Searches&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After the scope was finalised, a systematic search strategy was developed to locate all the relevant evidence. The balance between sensitivity (the power to identify all studies on a particular topic) and specificity (the ability to exclude irrelevant studies from the results) was carefully considered, and a decision made to utilise a broad approach to searching, to identify as complete a set as possible of clinically relevant studies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Searches were conducted in the following databases:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;CINAHL &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;EMBASE &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Medline/Medline In-Process &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;PsycINFO &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;CENTRAL &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;CDSR &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;DARE &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The search strategies were initially developed for Medline before being translated for use in other databases/interfaces. Strategies were built up from a number of trial searches, and discussions of the results of the searches with the review team/GDG, to ensure that all possible relevant search terms were covered.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See Section 3.5 in the full version of the original guideline for additional information about use of Reference Manager, search filters, date and language restrictions, post-guideline searching, and other search methods. Full details of the Medline search strategies/filters used for the systematic review of clinical evidence are provided in Appendix 6&amp;nbsp;in the full version of the original guideline document.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Study Selection and Quality Assessment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All studies included after the first scan of citations were acquired in full and re-evaluated for eligibility at the time they were being entered into Review Manager or evidence tables. More specific eligibility criteria were developed for each review question and are described in the relevant clinical evidence chapters in the full version of the original guideline document. Eligible systematic reviews and primary-level studies were critically appraised for methodological quality (see Appendix 7 in the full version of the original guideline document for methodology checklists). The eligibility of each study was confirmed by at least one member of the appropriate topic group.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For some review questions, it was necessary to prioritise the evidence with respect&amp;nbsp;to the UK context (that is, external validity). To make this process explicit, the GDG took into account the following factors when assessing the evidence:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Participant factors (for example, gender, age and ethnicity) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Provider factors (for example, model fidelity, the conditions under which the intervention was performed and the availability of experienced staff to undertake the procedure) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Cultural factors (for example, differences in standard care and differences in the welfare system) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was the responsibility of each topic group to decide which prioritisation factors were relevant to each review question in light of the UK context and then decide how they should modify their recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unpublished Evidence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The GDG used a number of criteria when deciding whether or not to accept unpublished data. First, the evidence must have been accompanied by a trial report containing sufficient detail to properly assess the quality of the data. Second, the evidence must have been submitted with the understanding that data from the study and a summary of the study's characteristics would be published in the full guideline. Therefore, the GDG did not accept evidence submitted as commercial in confidence. However, the GDG recognised that unpublished evidence submitted by investigators might later be retracted by those investigators if the inclusion of such data would jeopardise publication of their research.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Health Economics Methods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Search Strategy for Economic Evidence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scoping Searches&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A broad preliminary search of the literature was undertaken in October 2009 to obtain an overview of the issues likely to be covered by the scope, and help define key areas. Searches were restricted to economic studies and health technology assessment reports. Any relevant economic evidence arising from the clinical scoping searches was also made available to the health economist during the same period. See Section 3.6.1 in the full version of the original guideline document for more detail.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Systematic Literature Searches&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After the scope was finalised, a systematic search strategy was developed to locate all the relevant evidence. The balance between sensitivity (the power to identify all studies on a particular topic) and specificity (the ability to exclude irrelevant studies from the results) was carefully considered, and a decision made to utilise a broad approach to searching to maximise retrieval performance. Searches were restricted to economic evidence (including full and partial economic evaluations) and health technology assessment reports, and conducted in the following databases:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;EconLit &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;EMBASE &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;MEDLINE/MEDLINE In-Process &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;PsycINFO &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Health Technology Assessment (HTA) database (technology assessments) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;NHS EED &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Any relevant economic evidence arising from the clinical searches was also made available to the health economist during the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The search strategies were initially developed for MEDLINE before being translated for use in other databases/interfaces.

The methodology checklist for economic evaluations was also applied to the economic models developed specifically for this guideline. All studies that fully or partially met the applicability and quality criteria described in the methodology checklist were considered during the guideline development process, along with the results of the economic modelling conducted specifically for this guideline. The completed methodology checklists for all economic evaluations considered in the guideline are provided in Appendix 12 in the full version of the original guideline document.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results of the Systematic Search of Economic Literature&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The titles of all studies identified by the systematic search of the literature were screened for their relevance to the topic (i.e., economic issues and information on health-related quality of life in people with common mental health disorders). References that were clearly not relevant were excluded first. The abstracts of all potentially relevant studies (235 references) were then assessed against the inclusion criteria for economic evaluations by the health economist. Full texts of the studies potentially meeting the inclusion criteria (including those for which eligibility was not clear from the abstract) were obtained. Studies that did not meet the inclusion criteria, were duplicates, were secondary publications of one study, or had been updated in more recent publications were subsequently excluded. Economic evaluations eligible for inclusion (that is, one study on stepped care and one study on identification methods) were then appraised for their applicability and quality using the methodology checklist for economic evaluations. Of these, one economic study met, fully or partially, the applicability and quality criteria and was considered at formulation of the guideline recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="136" OrdBy="415" ID="408" Name="Number of Source Documents" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not stated&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="115" OrdBy="420" ID="409" Name="Methods Used to Assess the Quality and Strength of the Evidence" Type="picklist-choice"><FieldValue Value="Weighting According to a Rating Scheme (Scheme Not Given)" /></Field><Field FieldID="149" OrdBy="425" ID="410" Name="Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not stated&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="116" OrdBy="430" ID="411" Name="Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence" Type="picklist-many"><FieldValue Value="Meta-Analysis" /><FieldValue Value="Review of Published Meta-Analyses" /><FieldValue Value="Systematic Review with Evidence Tables" /></Field><Field FieldID="150" OrdBy="435" ID="412" Name="Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)&lt;/strong&gt;: This guideline was developed by the National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health on behalf of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE).

In most cases, a preliminary synthesis was made using tabulation. This was then used to write an evidence summary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meta-analysis of Diagnostic Accuracy Data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Review Manager 5 was used to summarise diagnostic accuracy data from each study using forest plots and summary receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plots. Where more than two studies reported appropriate data, a bivariate diagnostic accuracy meta-analysis was conducted using Stata 10 with the MIDAS (Module for Meta-analytical Integration of Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies) command in order to obtain pooled estimates of sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios, and diagnostic odds ratio (OR).

This was achieved by:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Systematic literature review of existing economic evidence &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Decision-analytic economic modelling &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Systematic reviews of economic literature were conducted in all areas covered in the guideline. Economic modelling was undertaken in areas with likely major resource implications, where available clinical evidence was sufficient to allow the development of an economic model that would provide fairly robust evidence on the cost effectiveness of interventions for the management of people with common mental health disorders. Prioritisation of areas for economic modelling was a joint decision between the health economist and the GDG. After considering areas with potentially significant resource implications and the availability of respective clinical data, the following economic question was selected as a key issue that was addressed by economic modelling:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Cost effectiveness of case identification for people with common mental health disorders. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition, literature on the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of people with common mental health disorders, especially anxiety and depression, was systematically searched to identify studies reporting appropriate utility scores that could be utilised in a cost-utility analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="112" OrdBy="440" ID="413" Name="Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations" Type="picklist-choice"><FieldValue Value="Expert Consensus" /><FieldValue Value="Informal Consensus" /></Field><Field FieldID="145" OrdBy="445" ID="414" Name="Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)&lt;/strong&gt;: This guideline was developed by the National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health (NCCMH) on behalf of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). See the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field for the full version of this guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review Questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Review (clinical) questions were used to guide the identification and interrogation of the evidence base relevant to the topic of the guideline. Before the first Guideline Development Group (GDG) meeting, an analytic framework (see Appendix 4 in the full version of the original guideline) was prepared by NCCMH staff based on the scope and an overview of existing guidelines, and discussed with the guideline Chair. The framework was used to provide a structure from which the review questions were drafted. Both the analytic framework and the draft review questions were then discussed by the GDG at the first few meetings and amended as necessary. Where appropriate, the framework and questions were refined once the evidence had been searched and, where necessary, sub-questions were generated. Questions submitted by stakeholders were also discussed by the GDG and the rationale for not including any questions was recorded in the minutes. The final list of review questions can be found in Appendix 4 in the full version of the original guideline.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The GDG&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The GDG consisted of professionals in psychiatry, clinical psychology, nursing, and general practice; academic experts in psychiatry and psychology; two people with a common mental health disorder and a carer. The guideline development process was supported by staff from the NCCMH, who undertook the clinical and health economics literature searches, reviewed and presented the evidence to the GDG, managed the process, and contributed to drafting the guideline.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GDG Meetings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nine GDG meetings were held between December 2009 and January 2011. During each day-long GDG meeting review questions and clinical and economic evidence were reviewed and assessed, and recommendations formulated. At each meeting, all GDG members declared any potential conflicts of interest, and service user and carer concerns were routinely discussed as part of a standing agenda.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Topic Groups&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The GDG divided its workload along clinically relevant lines to simplify the guideline development process, and GDG members formed smaller topic groups to undertake guideline work in that area of clinical practice. Topic Group 1 covered questions relating to access to healthcare. Topic Group 2 covered case identification, Topic Group 3 covered assessment, and Topic Group 4 covered systems for organising and developing local care pathways. These groups were designed to efficiently manage the large volume of evidence appraisal prior to presenting it to the GDG as a whole. Each topic group was chaired by a GDG member with expert knowledge of the topic area (one of the healthcare professionals). Topic groups were responsible for refining the review questions relevant to the topic, and assisted with the review and synthesis of the evidence. All decisions concerning recommendations were made by the full GDG. Topic group leaders reported the status of the group's work as part of the standing agenda. They also introduced and led the GDG discussion of the evidence review for that topic and assisted the technical staff from the NCCMH in drafting the section of the guideline relevant to the work of each topic group.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Service Users and Carers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Individuals with direct experience of services gave an integral service-user focus to the GDG and the guideline. The GDG included two people with a common mental health disorder and a carer. They contributed as full GDG members to writing the review questions, helping to ensure that the evidence addressed their views and preferences, highlighting sensitive issues and terminology relevant to the guideline, and bringing service-user research to the attention of the GDG. In drafting the guideline, they contributed to developing the evidence chapters and identified recommendations from the service user and carer perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From Evidence to Recommendations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once the clinical and health economic evidence was summarised, the GDG drafted the recommendations. The GDG took account of the principles of stepped-care approaches when considering the evidence and formulating recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In making recommendations, the GDG took into account the trade-off between the benefits and downsides of the intervention/instrument, as well as other important factors, such as economic considerations, values of the development group and society, the requirements to prevent discrimination and to promote equality, and the group's awareness of practical issues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, to show clearly how the GDG moved from the evidence to the recommendations, each chapter has a section called 'from evidence to recommendations'. Underpinning this section is the concept of the 'strength' of a recommendation. This takes into account the quality of the evidence but is conceptually different. Some recommendations are 'strong' in that the GDG believes that the vast majority of healthcare professionals and patients would choose a particular intervention if they considered the evidence in the same way that the GDG has. This is generally the case if the benefits clearly outweigh the harms for most people and the intervention is likely to be cost effective. However, there is often a closer balance between benefits and harms, and some patients would not choose an intervention whereas others would. This may happen, for example, if some service users are particularly averse to some side effect and others are not. In these circumstances the recommendation is generally weaker, although it may be possible to make stronger recommendations about specific groups of patients. The strength of each recommendation is reflected in the wording of the recommendation, rather than by using ratings, labels, or symbols.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="146" OrdBy="450" ID="415" Name="Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not applicable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="148" OrdBy="460" ID="417" Name="Cost Analysis" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Presentation of Economic Evidence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The economic evidence considered in the guideline is provided in the respective evidence chapters in the full version of the original guideline document, following presentation of the relevant clinical evidence.

The economic analysis undertaken for this guideline suggests that the use of formal identification tools (generalised anxiety disorder-2 [GAD-2] followed by GAD-7) comprises a cost-effective option when compared to GP assessment alone (without using formal identification tools) for people with GAD (as a proxy for the anxiety disorders), as it appears to result in better outcomes (more people identified and higher number of quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]) and lower total costs.

Consider asking the person about their feelings of anxiety and their ability to stop or control worry, using the 2-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-2; see Appendix D in the original guideline document).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;If the person scores three or more on the GAD-2 scale, consider an anxiety disorder and follow the recommendations for assessment (see &quot;Assessment&quot; below). &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;If the person scores less than three on the GAD-2 scale, but you are still concerned they may have an anxiety disorder, ask the following: 'Do you find yourself avoiding places or activities and does this cause you problems?'. If the person answers 'yes' to this question consider an anxiety disorder and follow the recommendations for assessment (see &quot;Assessment&quot; below). &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For people with significant language or communication difficulties, for example people with sensory impairments or a learning disability, consider using the Distress Thermometer* and/or asking a family member or carer about the person's symptoms to identify a possible common mental health disorder. If a significant level of distress is identified, offer further assessment or seek the advice of a specialist (adapted from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/CG90&quot; title=&quot;NICE Web site&quot;&gt;Depression.
