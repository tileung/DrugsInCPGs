Articles were limited to randomized clinical trials (RCTs) or controlled clinical trials (CCTs) of human subjects reported in English with an available abstract. The study duration must have been &amp;ge;6 months and all subjects were required to have incident or prevalent glucocorticoid use. With the assistance of a professional research librarian, the authors replicated the search strategy employed in the Comparative Effectiveness of Treatments for Low Bone Density (including Osteoporosis) Report prepared for the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality for alendronate, risedronate, ibandronate, zoledronic acid, calcitonin, teriparatide, and strontium. They searched Medline (through PubMed) by applying MeSH headings and relevant keywords with references from January 1966 through August 28, 2008 using Cochrane's Highly Selective Search Strategy to improve the specificity of the search. Searches for calcium, vitamin D, estrogen, and testosterone were performed in a similar manner, but limited to GIOP. Using the Cochrane Handbook's guidance, they also conducted similar searches of EMBASE in CENTRAL. Details of the search strategy are listed in Supplementary Appendix A (available in the online version of this article &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.20295/suppinfo&quot; title=&quot;Wiley Web site&quot;&gt;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.20295/suppinfo&lt;/a&gt;). Additionally, abstracts from the 2007&amp;ndash;2008 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Annual Scientific Meeting, European League Against Rheumatism annual European Congress of Rheumatology, Annual Meeting of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research, and European Calcific Tissue Society European Symposium on Calcified Tissues were manually searched for relevant RCTs. The Core Executive Panel and Expert Advisory Panel members contributed expert-identified studies to complete the search.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Three reviewers screened each title and abstract for relevance to the specific aims of the predefined inclusion criteria for the evidence report.

For each randomized controlled trial (RCT) and controlled clinical trial (CCT), study characteristics, sample size, outcomes, and quality assessment (calculated using the 5-point Jadad score) were reported in tabular form. Jadad scores are based on a 5-point scale, with higher scores suggesting higher-quality studies. The mean Jadad score for the 53 included articles was 2.44 (interquartile range 1&amp;ndash;3). This score indicated that the articles as a whole were of only moderate quality. The principal investigator adjudicated discrepant results. Relevant meta-analyses were also described in the report.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The function of the evidence report was to provide the data for evaluation of clinical scenarios used to illustrate the key permutations of potential clinical interventions for the evaluation and management of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis. Some clinical scenarios, such as those involving repeat bone mineral density (BMD) testing, did not have RCT data as supportive evidence. In those situations, qualitative literature reviews and expert-identified articles were used to summarize existing evidence. This summarized data helped to guide the development of the clinical scenarios and formed the basis for the evidence report that was used in the next phase of the recommendations development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="112" OrdBy="440" ID="413" Name="Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations" Type="picklist-choice"><FieldValue Value="Expert Consensus (Delphi)" /><FieldValue Value="Expert Consensus (Nominal Group Technique)" /></Field><Field FieldID="145" OrdBy="445" ID="414" Name="Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Topic Development&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To update the recommendations, the guideline authors incorporated the existing concepts from the 2001 guidelines and also refined the scope of the project. The guideline authors convened an Expert Advisory Panel comprised of 6 rheumatologists with expertise in glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP), including guideline development. To narrow the scope of the work and because of limited available data in certain areas, the Expert Advisory Panel set the following restrictions for the recommendations: first, the inclusion of medications approved for use in the treatment of osteoporosis in the United States, Canada, or the European Union; second, the exclusion of GIOP in the transplant populations; third, the exclusion of GIOP in the pediatric population; and fourth, the exclusion of inhaled glucocorticoids.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The guideline authors next constructed the clinical scenarios that would be used by the Task Force Panel to develop the recommendations. An example of a clinical scenario was &quot;In a high risk patient starting glucocorticoids with an anticipated duration of &amp;gt;3 months or on long-term therapy, which of the following medications would be appropriate to use based on a range of glucocorticoid doses?&quot; followed by the list of all potential medications to treat or prevent GIOP. The complete set of scenarios is available in the Supplementary Appendix (available in the online version of this article at &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.20295/suppinfo&quot; title=&quot;Wiley Web site&quot;&gt;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.20295/suppinfo&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In an effort to make the process of evaluating the clinical scenarios both feasible and clinically meaningful, the guideline authors collapsed multiple risk factors for fractures into 3 fracture risk categories: high, medium, and low risk, guided in part by the FRAX risk assessment tool. The FRAX tool uses updated, evidence-based estimates of absolute fracture risk and was created for the purpose of quantitatively integrating numerous clinical factors into a clinically useful risk prediction model. Using the FRAX calculator, the Expert Advisory Panel defined a 10-year risk of a major osteoporotic fracture of 10% or less as low risk, 10&amp;ndash;20% as medium risk, and greater than 20% or a T score of less than or equal to -2.5 or a history of a fragility fracture as high risk (which is the threshold for cost-effective treatment recommended by the National Osteoporosis Foundation). See Figure 2 in the original guideline document for typical examples of postmenopausal women and men age &amp;ge;50 years with a history of glucocorticoid use at high, medium, and low risk of fracture in the absence of other risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research and Development/University of California, Los Angeles (RAND/UCLA) Appropriateness Method Used by the Task Force Panel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method, which incorporates elements of the nominal and Delphi method, was used to generate the recommendations presented in this report. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method was developed to combine the best available scientific evidence with the collective judgment of experts to yield a statement regarding the appropriateness of a treatment based on patient-specific symptoms, medical history, and test results. The method combines a systematic review of the scientific literature with expert opinion and yields specific criteria of appropriateness that can be used as the basis for review criteria, practice guidelines, or both. This technique has previously been described as the best systematic method of combining expert opinion and evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As the first step in this process, the Task Force Panel, which consisted of 10 individuals from the fields of rheumatology, endocrinology, and geriatrics, and a patient care advocate, received the evidence report and case scenarios. The Task Force Panel independently rated the appropriateness of the specific interventions within the context of the clinical scenarios with varying fracture risk, glucocorticoid dose, and duration. Instructions for grading scenarios and definitions of all variables were provided by e-mail and discussed during a conference call. The Task Force Panel was asked to use the evidence as summarized in the evidence report as well as their own clinical judgment to rate the appropriateness of employing a particular therapy in the context of each clinical scenarios using a 9-point Likert scale, where 1 = appropriate and 9 = not appropriate. Results from the first round of voting were tabulated and presented at a face-to-face panel meeting comprised of the Core Expert Panel and Task Force Panel. The summarized anonymous scores, including range and median as well as the panelist's own ranking, were provided to each voting member. Areas of discrepancy as well as areas of agreement were discussed and a second round of anonymous voting by the Task Force Panel alone occurred using the same scale. Vitamin D and calcium were evaluated as additive therapy and testosterone and estrogen as primary therapy in hypogonadal patients. The results of the second round of voting determined the updated recommendations. The clinical scenarios specifically did not attempt to prioritize the use of one drug over another when both were deemed appropriate in a particular circumstance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the face-to-face meeting, additional questions related to risk factors for premenopausal patients arose that were not adequately addressed by the systematic review. Therefore, voting for premenopausal women and for men age &amp;lt;50 years without prior fragility fracture was deferred until an additional literature search to identify non-randomized controlled trial/controlled clinical trial (RCT/CCT) studies had been performed and disseminated to panel members and discussed in a subsequent conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Statistical Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Recommendations applying to individual scenarios were endorsed when the median score from the panelist voting fell in the 1 to 3 range and there was no disagreement. Disagreement was defined as 3 or more of the 10 voting panelists rating the scenario in the middle or highest tertiles (i.e., 4 to 9). Only positive statements were included in the recommendations. Absence of any recommendation should not be construed to suggest that a treatment was inappropriate in particular settings; the absence of a recommendation generally implied only inadequate or conflicting evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The authors used the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation (AGREE) instrument to help assure that the updated recommendations covered all the important domains and attributes. The AGREE instrument grades elements of validity and includes 6 sections: scope and purpose, stakeholder involvement, rigor of development, clarity and presentation, applicability, and editorial independence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="146" OrdBy="450" ID="415" Name="Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not applicable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="148" OrdBy="460" ID="417" Name="Cost Analysis" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A formal cost analysis was not performed and published cost analyses were not reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="104" OrdBy="465" ID="418" Name="Method of Guideline Validation" Type="picklist-choice"><FieldValue Value="Internal Peer Review" /></Field><Field FieldID="130" OrdBy="470" ID="419" Name="Description of Method of Guideline Validation" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to traditional manuscript review, a draft of the evidence report was submitted to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Guidelines Subcommittee, ACR Quality of Care Committee, and ACR Board of Directors for comments and recommendations, which were incorporated into the final recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field></Section><Section SecID="420" OrdBy="500" Name="Recommendations"><Field FieldID="151" OrdBy="505" ID="421" Name="Major Recommendations" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The levels of evidence supporting the recommendations (A-C) are defined at the end of the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendations for Assessment, Counseling for Lifestyle Modifications, and Followup of All Patients Receiving Glucocorticoid Therapy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The 17 recommendations concerning counseling for lifestyle modifications and followup of patients receiving glucocorticoids are shown in the tables below. In addition to the recommendations listed, using the smallest dose of glucocorticoid for the shortest duration possible was recommended as an important strategy to minimize osteoporosis risk.

A variety of other approaches to fall risk evaluation are also available. The panel recommended that clinicians consider vertebral fracture assessment (VFA), especially in the setting of significant height loss or a history of back pain consistent with a fracture, or conventional spine imaging because vertebral fractures are often asymptomatic, and might change treatment recommendations for patients receiving steroids who would otherwise be considered a low or medium risk. While grade 2 and 3 vertebral fractures classified according to the Genant semiquantitative method have been shown to have high specificity for vertebral fracture, the panel noted that more research is needed to improve the specificity of grade 1 fractures noted on vertebral fracture assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Calcium and vitamin D supplementation counseling was recommended for all patients beginning glucocorticoid therapy. Vitamin D supplementation to achieve &quot;therapeutic&quot; levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, or dosages of 800&amp;ndash;1,000 IU/day are 2 target dosing regimens; however, glucocorticoids can interfere with vitamin D absorption and may necessitate a higher supplementation dose to achieve therapeutic levels. Although serial bone density testing was recommended, the interval of such testing remains controversial. Factors that will influence the frequency of testing include the presence of additional risk factors for fracture, whether or not osteoporosis therapy has already been initiated, the results of the previous bone mineral density (BMD), the dose of steroids, and the rate of change of the BMD.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendations for Low- and Medium-Risk Postmenopausal Glucocorticoid-Treated Women and Glucocorticoid-Treated Men Age &amp;ge;50 Years&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The recommendations for low- and medium-risk patients, as shown in the table below, were to start prescription osteoporosis therapy for patients with an anticipated glucocorticoid usage duration of &amp;ge;3 months or those on prevalent glucocorticoid therapy for at least 3 months.

These 2 populations were thought to represent a similar patient group, insofar as there is limited evidence for the treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP) in both these populations. Furthermore, the risk factors that influence fracture propensity in these populations have not been well defined. The Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) tool is currently not applicable to premenopausal women or men younger than age 40 years. Additionally, the long-term safety of medications used to treat GIOP in this population, and the risk of these medications to a fetus, either from current or previous exposure, is not well defined. For these reasons, the panel concluded that they could make recommendations only for those with a prevalent fragility fracture who were clearly at higher risk for additional fracture. For women of childbearing potential, drugs with shorter half-lives were recommended (as shown in the table below). For those of nonchildbearing potential, the recommendations were similar to those for postmenopausal women and for men except that the anticipated duration of glucocorticoids required to trigger therapy was 3 months. The panel suggested this area warranted further research.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Table: Recommendations for Premenopausal Women and Men Under Age 50 Years with a History of Fragility Fracture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;
