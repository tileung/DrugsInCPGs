No comparator of placebo, conventional disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or biologic agents will be available, so it is unclear how these 5-year studies can establish effectiveness. It is debatable whether follow-up in the five included studies (24 weeks) is adequate. It is not possible to tell whether any initial treatment effect wanes after time with this short length of follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Describe and Critique the Statistical Approach Used&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The randomised controlled trials (RCTs) used standard approaches to statistical analyses. For individual RCT results, per protocol and intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses were available in the trial reports. Only the American College of Rheumatology (ACR)20, ACR50 and ACR70 results for Option (WA17822), Lithe (17823) and Toward (WA18063) RCTs were presented in the submission.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critique of Submitted Evidence Syntheses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The meta-analysis was of three RCTs only &amp;ndash; Option (WA17822), Lithe (WA17823) and Toward (WA18063) because the participants in these RCTs had an inadequate response to methotrexate (MTX) or DMARD. The comparator in the meta-analysis was placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The meta-analysis result in the plot shown in the ERG report does not appear to be based on the adjusted odds ratios from the three trials as it looks to be too far to the left. Also the scale is not logarithmic. The axis in the submission plot is labelled odds ratio (OR) but zero and minus-one appear on the axis; minus-one is an impossible value for odds ratio and makes the plot confusing. These values are familiar for log odds ratio but it is clear that the confidence intervals (CIs) correspond to an OR rather than a log OR (i.e., they are not symmetrical about the point estimates). For a forest plot of OR to do this the x axis needs to be on a log scale. A plot of log OR would provide symmetrical CIs with the axis linear on a log OR scale.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The forest plot has been redrawn (see the ERG report) to include the unadjusted odds ratios reported for the studies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is unclear if or how the meta-analysis was used subsequently in the submission. The submission used ACR50 and ACR70 results as well as ACR20 scores to obtain Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) values and thence utility estimates to feed the economic model. However no meta-analyses of these outcomes were presented.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Refer to Section 4 of the ERG report (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) for additional information.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the original submission, the manufacturer of tocilizumab provided updated data with a maximum of 180 weeks of follow-up. The response rates of all people who received at least one dose of tocilizumab in the OPTION, AMBITION, RADIATE and TOWARD trials were analysed. A total of 3986 people were included in the long-term analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economic Evaluation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overview of Manufacturer's Economic Evaluation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As there were no United Kingdom (UK)-based economic evaluations of tocilizumab, the manufacturer conducted a &lt;em&gt;de novo&lt;/em&gt; economic model. Table 6 of the ERG report summarises the key features of the model.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Populations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Two patient cohorts were considered, consistent with the licensed indication of tocilizumab:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients who have had an inadequate response to one or more traditional DMARDs. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Moderate to severe RA patients who have had an inadequate response to one or more anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-&amp;alpha; agents. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that no subgroup analysis of patients intolerant to methotrexate (MTX) was conducted, even though these patients are specifically mentioned in the scope. The submission assumes that tocilizumab will be administered together with MTX, so the submission has not shown any evidence of cost-effectiveness in a MTX-intolerant population.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Perspective and Time Horizon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Costs were considered from a National Health Service (NHS) and Personal Social Services perspective (in practice NHS only), consistent with the NICE reference case. A time horizon over a patient lifetime was applied, as is appropriate for a chronic disease.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Model Validation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Refer to Section 5.1 of the ERG report for information on model validation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critique of Approach Used&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A summary of the model and critical appraisal of its features can be found in Appendix 3 of the ERG report.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Refer to Section 5 of the ERG report (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) for additional information on the economic analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="112" OrdBy="440" ID="413" Name="Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations" Type="picklist-choice"><FieldValue Value="Expert Consensus" /></Field><Field FieldID="145" OrdBy="445" ID="414" Name="Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Considerations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Technology appraisal recommendations are based on a review of clinical and economic evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technology Appraisal Process&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) invites 'consultee' and 'commentator' organisations to take part in the appraisal process. Consultee organisations include national groups representing patients and carers, the bodies representing health professionals, and the manufacturers of the technology under review. Consultees are invited to submit evidence during the appraisal and to comment on the appraisal documents.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Commentator organisations include manufacturers of the products with which the technology is being compared, the National Health Service (NHS) Quality Improvement Scotland and research groups working in the area. They can comment on the evidence and other documents but are not asked to submit evidence themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;NICE then commissions an independent academic centre to review published evidence on the technology and prepare an 'assessment report'. Consultees and commentators are invited to comment on the report. The assessment report and the comments on it are then drawn together in a document called the evaluation report.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An independent Appraisal Committee then considers the evaluation report. It holds a meeting where it hears direct, spoken evidence from nominated clinical experts, patients and carers. The Committee uses all the evidence to make its first recommendations, in a document called the 'appraisal consultation document' (ACD). NICE sends all the consultees and commentators a copy of this document and posts it on the NICE website. Further comments are invited from everyone taking part.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the Committee meets again it considers any comments submitted on the ACD; then it prepares its final recommendations in a document called the 'final appraisal determination' (FAD). This is submitted to NICE for approval.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Consultees have a chance to appeal against the final recommendations in the FAD. If there are no appeals, the final recommendations become the basis of the guidance that NICE issues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who Is on the Appraisal Committee?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;NICE technology appraisal recommendations are prepared by an independent committee. This includes health professionals working in the NHS and people who are familiar with the issues affecting patients and carers. Although the Appraisal Committee seeks the views of organisations representing health professionals, patients, carers, manufacturers and government, its advice is independent of any vested interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="146" OrdBy="450" ID="415" Name="Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not applicable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="148" OrdBy="460" ID="417" Name="Cost Analysis" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The manufacturer did not identify any economic evaluations of tocilizumab and developed an economic model for the submission. This was an individual sampling model with a hypothetical homogenous cohort. The model used a lifetime horizon for costs and benefits. The manufacturer's initial economic model compared a treatment sequence that included tocilizumab with the same treatment sequence without tocilizumab for two populations. For the DMARD-IR population (people whose rheumatoid arthritis had responded inadequately to previous disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs [DMARDs] but before treatment with a tumour necrosis factor alpha [TNF-&amp;alpha;] inhibitor), tocilizumab plus methotrexate was the first biological treatment and if the condition did not respond or if the American College of Rheumatology (ACR)20 response rate was no longer achieved then etanercept plus methotrexate was the next treatment. This was followed by rituximab plus methotrexate, then leflunomide, then gold, then ciclosporin until people withdrew from the last treatment (ciclosporin) and moved on to palliative care. The sequence was the same for the comparator arm, but excluded tocilizumab plus methotrexate at the beginning. For the TNF-IR population (people whose rheumatoid arthritis had responded inadequately to previous TNF-&amp;alpha; inhibitors but before treatment with rituximab), the sequence was the same as the DMARD-IR population, except for the omission of etanercept plus methotrexate (that is, the first treatment in the comparator arm was rituximab plus methotrexate).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the DMARD-IR population, the treatment sequence including tocilizumab plus methotrexate compared with the sequence without tocilizumab produced incremental costs of &amp;pound;23,253 and incremental quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of 1.17. This resulted in a base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of &amp;pound;19,870 per QALY gained. For the TNF-IR population, the treatment sequence including tocilizumab plus methotrexate compared with the sequence without tocilizumab produced incremental costs of &amp;pound;26,640 and incremental QALYs of 1.21. This resulted in a base-case ICER of &amp;pound;22,003 per QALY gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses suggested that the addition of tocilizumab and methotrexate to the treatment sequences had a 56.4% and 22.4% probability of being cost effective (for the DMARD-IR and TNF-IR populations respectively) if the maximum acceptable amount to pay for a QALY gained is &amp;pound;20,000. All scenario analyses presented by the manufacturer resulted in ICERs of less than &amp;pound;30,000 per QALY gained. The ICERs increased to &amp;pound;24,905 and &amp;pound;24,739 per QALY gained for the DMARD-IR and TNF-IR populations respectively, using an assumption of no change in Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) score (that is, no continued improvement on tocilizumab after the initial ACR response).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In response to three rounds of consultation for the original guidance on tocilizumab for rheumatoid arthritis (National Institute for Clinical Excellence and Health [NICE] technology appraisal guidance 198), the manufacturer presented revised ICERs for the DMARD-IR and TNF-IR populations incorporating some of the Evidence Review Group's (ERG's) suggested changes. The manufacturer's revised ICER for the DMARD-IR population increased from &amp;pound;19,870 to &amp;pound;21,733 per QALY gained, and increased from &amp;pound;22,003 to &amp;pound;23,285 per QALY gained for the TNF-IR population. The ICER for tocilizumab used after rituximab was &amp;pound;23,735 per QALY gained. The ICER for tocilizumab for people who are intolerant to rituximab or for whom rituximab is contraindicated was &amp;pound;20,242 per QALY gained.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decision Support Unit Report 2010&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In 2010, the Decision Support Unit (DSU) was asked to undertake additional cost-effectiveness analyses to validate the manufacturer's ICERs submitted after the third round of consultation, and to conduct sensitivity analyses to address the Appraisal Committee's concerns about key parameter assumptions. Using the threshold for cost-effectiveness (&amp;pound;30,000 per QALY gained), the results of the fully incremental analysis undertaken by the DSU&amp;nbsp;in the 2010 report indicated that using tocilizumab as a first-line treatment before etanercept would not be cost effective for any approach and with any set of parameter assumptions (including the manufacturer's base-case assumptions). Using tocilizumab as a second-line treatment before rituximab would only be cost effective if it is assumed that tocilizumab has long-term HAQ improvement and there is no HAQ improvement assumed with other biological treatments. However, if tocilizumab has zero HAQ improvement, then tocilizumab would only be cost effective when used as a third-line treatment after rituximab. If tocilizumab has zero HAQ improvement and the administration costs of tocilizumab are doubled, then tocilizumab is never cost effective (that is, standard care is the most cost-effective sequence). For patients who have an intolerance to rituximab, or for whom rituximab is contraindicated, adding tocilizumab to the current standard care is cost effective. However, if tocilizumab does not have a different effect on long-term HAQ and the administration costs of tocilizumab are doubled, then the current standard care would be more cost effective for this population.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decision Support Unit Report 2011&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In 2011, the DSU was asked to undertake a review of whether the manufacturer had correctly implemented the Department of Health approved patient access scheme within their cost-effectiveness analysis. Additionally the DSU critiqued the changes to the costs of tocilizumab and ensured the Committee's agreed assumptions from the guidance on tocilizumab for rheumatoid arthritis (NICE technology appraisal guidance 198) had been used as the starting point within the economic analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The DSU reported the results of their exploratory analysis for the DMARD-IR population, which included the same treatment sequences in an incremental analysis as those modelled by the manufacturer. All ICERs incorporated the discount for tocilizumab agreed as part of the patient access scheme. In this analysis, three sequences were extendedly dominated (first: etanercept followed by rituximab; second: tocilizumab as the first treatment; third: tocilizumab as the second treatment). The ICER for tocilizumab as the third treatment in the sequence was &amp;pound;28,380 per QALY gained compared with &amp;pound;8134 per QALY gained from the manufacturer's analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The DSU reported the results of their exploratory analysis for the TNF-IR population, which included the same treatment sequences in an incremental analysis as those modelled by the manufacturer. All ICERs incorporated the discount for tocilizumab agreed as part of the patient access scheme. In this analysis, tocilizumab followed by rituximab was dominated (was less effective than and at least as costly) by rituximab followed by tocilizumab. The ICER for rituximab followed by tocilizumab was &amp;pound;18,527 per QALY gained compared with the manufacturer's estimate of &amp;pound;22,690 per QALY gained.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary of Appraisal Committee's Key Conclusions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The manufacturer's analysis had not taken into account extended dominance and that this had an impact on the ICERs. The Committee concluded that the DSU's 2011 exploratory analyses should be used as the basis for determining the cost-effectiveness of tocilizumab.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Incorporation of Health-Related Quality-of-Life Benefits and Utility Values&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Committee noted that the manufacturer's mapping of HAQ scores to European quality of life health-state questionnaire (EQ-5D) utility values resulted in negative utility values. The Committee heard from the manufacturer that it was possible that there were some people with rheumatoid arthritis who may experience negative utility values. The Committee therefore accepted that the calculation of some ICERs would include negative utility values but concluded that this was acceptable because of the low impact on the ICERs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are There Specific Groups of People for Whom the Technology Is Particularly Cost Effective?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Committee heard from the manufacturer that it was seeking a recommendation for tocilizumab as an option along with other biological treatments in the treatment pathway. It therefore considered that there were four possible scenarios for including tocilizumab in the treatment pathway:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Tocilizumab after two DMARDs as an alternative to TNF-&amp;alpha; inhibitors &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Tocilizumab after TNF-&amp;alpha; inhibitors as an alternative to rituximab &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Tocilizumab after TNF-&amp;alpha; inhibitors when a person is intolerant to rituximab or for whom rituximab is contraindicated &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Tocilizumab as an addition to the treatment pathway after rituximab &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What Are the Key Drivers of Cost-effectiveness?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Committee concluded that the improved cost-effectiveness of tocilizumab as the first biological treatment compared with etanercept was due to the cost of time on treatment, rather than any substantial differences in clinical or cost-effectiveness between tocilizumab and etanercept.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Most Likely Cost-effectiveness Estimate (Given as an ICER)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the DMARD-IR population: three sequences were extendedly dominated (less effective than and at least as costly as a combination of other drug sequences). When tocilizumab is the third biological in the sequence the most plausible estimate of the ICER is &amp;pound;28,400 per QALY gained. The Committee accepted that some uncertainty around the point estimates of the ICERs was likely.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the TNF-IR population: the Committee accepted the ICER of &amp;pound;18,500 per QALY gained as the most plausible ICER estimate for tocilizumab following rituximab in this population.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the DMARD-IR rituximab intolerant population: the Committee noted that the most plausible estimate for the ICER ranged from &amp;pound;10,700 per QALY gained for the sequence in which etanercept followed tocilizumab to &amp;pound;30,100 per QALY gained in the sequence where tocilizumab followed etanercept.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Refer to Sections 3 and 4 of the original guideline document for details of the economic analyses provided by the manufacturer, the Evidence Review Group's (ERG) comments, the DSU report, and the Appraisal Committee considerations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="104" OrdBy="465" ID="418" Name="Method of Guideline Validation" Type="picklist-choice"><FieldValue Value="External Peer Review" /></Field><Field FieldID="130" OrdBy="470" ID="419" Name="Description of Method of Guideline Validation" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consultee organisations from the following groups were invited to comment on the draft scope, Assessment Report and the Appraisal Consultation Document (ACD) and were provided with the opportunity to appeal against the Final Appraisal Determination.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;
