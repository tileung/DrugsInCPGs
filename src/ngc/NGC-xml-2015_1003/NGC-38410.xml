See the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field for the full version of this guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Search Strategies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Systematic search strategies were used to identify published evidence for the Osteoporosis guideline, and were run in accordance with the NICE Guidelines Manual 2009 (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field). Searches for clinical evidence were undertaken between Sept-Nov 2011. Any studies added to the databases after this date were not included unless specifically stated in the text.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scoping Searches&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Scoping searches were conducted in January 2011 using websites and databases listed in section C.4.2 in Appendix C of the full version of the original guideline document (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field). Browsing or simple search strategies were employed. The search results were used to provide information for scope development and project planning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Searches&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Search strategies for review questions were developed by the Information Scientist, with advice from the NCGC Clinical Guidelines Technical Team. Searches for clinical reviews were run in Medline and Embase (OVID), and in the Cochrane Library (Wiley) databases for review question 2. Typically, searches were constructed in the following way:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Clinical questions were translated into search strategies using subject heading and free text terms, following a PEO format. In this format Population (P) terms are combined with Exposure/Intervention (E) terms (as indicated in the tables under each individual question in section C.4.7 in Appendix C of the full version of the original guideline document [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]), and sometimes Outcome (O) terms. Study type filters were added where appropriate (see C.4.5 and question summary tables in Appendix C of the full version of the original guideline document [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]). &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economic Searches&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Searches for economic reviews were run in Medline (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), the National Health Service (NHS) Economic Evaluations Database (NHS EED), the Health Technology Assessment (HTA) database, and the Health Economic Evaluation Database (HEED). NHS EED and HTA were searched via the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) interface. For Medline and Embase an economic filter (see section C.4.5.4 in Appendix C of the full version of the original guideline document [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]) was added to population terms (see section C.4.6 in Appendix C of the full version of the original guideline document [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Economic searches were run in Medline and Embase by combining population terms with the economic filter and limiting by date range. Economic searches were executed in the NHS EED and HTA (CRD) databases by simply running population terms without a date limitation. Initial searches were conducted on 19/5/11. The population subsequently changed and a top up search was run on 13/9/11.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Details of the initial search are presented in section C.4.8.1 in Appendix C of the full version of the original guideline document. A top up search was conducted as the initial population was limited to osteoporotic fractures and changed post-scoping to encompass fragility fractures (for details see section C.4.8.2 in Appendix C of the full version of the original guideline document [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Following literature search, systematic reviewers sifted the set of titles and abstracts, and identified and retrieved potentially relevant studies, according to the pre-specified inclusion/exclusion criteria set in the protocols that were agreed by the GDG. The systematic reviewers then read the retrieved full-text papers and papers were excluded if they failed to meet the inclusion criteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="136" OrdBy="415" ID="408" Name="Number of Source Documents" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not stated&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="115" OrdBy="420" ID="409" Name="Methods Used to Assess the Quality and Strength of the Evidence" Type="picklist-choice"><FieldValue Value="Expert Consensus" /></Field><Field FieldID="149" OrdBy="425" ID="410" Name="Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not applicable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="116" OrdBy="430" ID="411" Name="Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence" Type="picklist-many"><FieldValue Value="Review of Published Meta-Analyses" /><FieldValue Value="Systematic Review with Evidence Tables" /></Field><Field FieldID="150" OrdBy="435" ID="412" Name="Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)&lt;/strong&gt;: This guideline was developed by the National Clinical Guideline Centre (NCGC) at the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). See the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field for the full version of this guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Quality assurance on studies identified through the literature search was carried out by a second reviewer to eliminate any potential of selection bias or error (10% of sifting and selection of papers, 10-20% data extraction). Quality assessment of studies was carried out using appropriate methodology checklists. See section C2 in Appendix C of the full version of the original guideline document (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) for more details about quality assessment with respect to each review question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Key information reported in the included studies was extracted, such as study and population characteristics, prognostic factors measurements, outcome measurements, number of incident fractures, length of follow up, loss to follow up, analysis details, main results findings and study limitations. In addition, evidence statements were produced. They are brief statement summarising key results and quality of the studies for a review question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The methods used for the two review questions are different and further details are now given separately for each type of prognostic review.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review Question 1: How Useful are Simple Clinical Measures for Targeting People for Risk Assessment of Fragility Fracture?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This review is concerned with the feasibility of &quot;triaging&quot; patients presenting to health care settings, in order to determine which patients should be given a full risk assessment for fragility fracture (as described in question 2, see section C3 of Appendix C of the full version of the original guideline document [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]). It was not thought practicable or likely cost effective to carry out a full risk assessment for all patients presenting, for instance, to their general practitioner, not least because many patients would have a very low risk of fracture; for example, a 23 year old man presenting with a sprained ankle. Therefore, this review sought to explore if there are some simple clinical measures or prognostic factors that can be used for targeting people for full risk assessment of fragility fracture (leading to appropriate treatment). The guideline development group (GDG) determined that there were two important features that would influence the usefulness of these simple measures:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;How strong the predictor is (magnitude of association) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;How common the condition is (prevalence) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, the GDG pre-specified the following simple measures/prognostic factors in the protocol: body mass index (BMI), prior oral corticosteroid use, family history of fracture, previous fracture, smoking, alcohol, history of falls, age, and other secondary causes of osteoporosis. Some of these are continuous variables (e.g., age), some are treated as categorical variables (e.g., alcohol, BMI) and some are truly dichotomous variables (e.g., family history of fracture). The GDG did not pre-specify particular cut-off points for prognostic factors that were continuous variables, so all cut-offs were included and reported (as well as the effect for the continuous variable). They also noted the reference category for variables that had more than one category.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See Appendix C of the full version of the original guideline document for a discussion of methods used for this review (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review Question 2: Which Risk Assessment Tools are the Most Accurate in Predicting the Risk of Fragility Fracture in Adults, Including Those without Known Osteoporosis or Previous Fragility Fracture?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This question is concerned with whether different combinations of prognostic factors (algorithms) accurately predict fragility fracture. Risk stratification algorithms or risk prediction models are derived using time-dependent regression analyses of patient level data - as discussed in question 1, above. This review focuses on validation studies and is much less concerned with analysing the derivation studies, except when examining whether the algorithms are clinically realistic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See Appendix C of the full version of the original guideline document (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) for a discussion of methods used for this review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="112" OrdBy="440" ID="413" Name="Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations" Type="picklist-choice"><FieldValue Value="Expert Consensus" /></Field><Field FieldID="145" OrdBy="445" ID="414" Name="Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)&lt;/strong&gt;: This guideline was developed by the National Clinical Guideline Centre (NCGC) at the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). See the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field for the full version of this guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This guideline was developed in accordance with the process for short clinical guidelines set out in 'The guidelines manual' (2009) (see &quot;The Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The NCGC established a Guideline Development Group, which reviewed the evidence and developed the recommendations. The NCGC worked with a group of healthcare professionals (including consultants, general practitioners, and nurses), patients and carers, and technical staff, who reviewed the evidence and drafted the recommendations. The recommendations were finalised after public consultation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developing the Review Questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Review questions were developed based on the scope. They were drafted by the review team and refined and validated by the guideline development group. This short guideline is concerned exclusively with prognosis, investigating either simple prognostic factors for osteoporotic fracture or the accuracy of risk stratification tools to predict fracture. Prognostic review protocols were written to address these issues and the principles adopted are described in more in Appendix C of the full version of the original guideline document.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A framework similar to the PICO format (population, intervention, comparison, and outcome[s]) for intervention studies was used for these questions and covered three main factors: Population, prognostic factor or risk stratification tool, and outcomes. This framework guided the literature searching process and facilitated GDG discussions and their development of recommendations. Review questions and protocols can be seen in section C5 in Appendix C of the full version of the original guideline document (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For all review questions across this guideline, standard systematic reviewing methods were used which involved five main steps: writing a review protocol in discussion with the guideline development group; searching the literature; selecting relevant studies against the pre-defined inclusion criteria; quality assessment of the included studies, analysis of the data and interpretation of the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="146" OrdBy="450" ID="415" Name="Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not applicable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="148" OrdBy="460" ID="417" Name="Cost Analysis" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review Question: Which Risk Assessment Tools Are the Most Accurate for Predicting the Risk of Fragility Fracture in Adults, Including Those without Known Osteoporosis or Previous Fragility Fracture?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health Economic Evidence Review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Five studies were identified that assessed the cost effectiveness of risk assessment tools but they were all excluded. Details of the five studies are reported in Table 104 in Appendix E of the full version of the original guideline document (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field). The remit of this guideline excludes treatment of osteoporosis. Therefore, studies that assessed the cost effectiveness of treatment strategies of osteoporosis were also excluded.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Economic Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Using tools to estimate the future risk of fragility fracture in patients has important economic implications. The use of risk assessment tools for fragility fracture is associated with the use of resources (e.g., general practitioner [GP] time). There may be considerable benefits when a risk assessment tool facilitates early intervention and prevention of fragility fracture. However, a risk assessment tool that overestimates the risk of fracture would lead to an increase of resource use. In this case, patients may receive unnecessary treatment and may not benefit from that treatment. On the other hand, a risk assessment tool that underestimates the risk of fracture would lead to under provision of prevention treatment. This would see an increase in hospitalisation costs and a reduction in Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although this is an area with significant economic implications, since prevention and treatment are outside the scope of this guideline, a full and formal cost-effectiveness analysis including long-term consequences of strategies was not conducted. Instead a simple cost analysis of performing the assessment tools and/or dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan was performed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods of Cost Analysis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Guideline Development Group (GDG) performed a cost analysis for a hypothetical cohort of patients presenting at the general practitioner. They assumed that an initial general practitioner assessment prior to risk assessment would be required for all patients and as such the cost of this was not incorporated in the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Comparators included in the analysis were:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;World Health Organization (WHO) Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;QFracture &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Bone mineral density (BMD) for all patients with no FRAX pre-screening &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;FRAX or QFracture followed by BMD when required &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The cost difference between FRAX and QFracture Risk Stratification Tools is negligible.
