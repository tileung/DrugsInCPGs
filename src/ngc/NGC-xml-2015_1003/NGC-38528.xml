One systematic review was supported by AOTA as part of an academic partnership with Eastern Kentucky University (EKU) as a major investigation project fulfilling the master's-degree requirement for a nonthesis contribution. The second systematic review was supported by AOTA as part of an academic partnership with the Medical College of Georgia (MCG). Two occupational therapy students participated in the project in partial completion of the requirements for their master's degree.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The literature searches for the evidence reviews covered the period 1990&amp;ndash;2009. More recent articles (2010&amp;ndash;2012) were also included based on the recommendations of content experts who participated in the external review process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the first academic partnership, three EKU graduate students, one faculty advisor, and AOTA project staff took part in the review. The EKU faculty advisor and AOTA staff developed the focused question. An advisory group consisting of occupational therapy practitioners, educators, and researchers with expertise in mental health provided input toward the development of the question. The EKU students, with support from AOTA staff and the advisory group, developed a search strategy to include the population, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and key search terms based on the population, interventions, and outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The key search terms for interventions were based on the following areas of occupation from the &lt;em&gt;Occupational Therapy Practice Framework: Domain and Process&lt;/em&gt;: work, instrumental activities of daily living (including homemaking and cooking), and education. To operationalize serious mental illness, the group used the Center for Mental Health Services' definition requiring a person to have at least one 12-month disorder other than a substance use disorder, to meet criteria according to the &lt;em&gt;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;DSM&amp;ndash;IV&amp;ndash;TR&lt;/em&gt;; American Psychiatric Association, 2000), and to have serious impairment (Substance Abuse Mental Health Services Administration Public Health Services Act, 1993). Table B2 in the original guideline document provides a comprehensive list of the search terms used for both systematic reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Articles included in the review met the following criteria: published in a peer-reviewed journal, limited to English-language articles, participants had a diagnosis of severe mental illness and were between the ages of 18 and 65, and interventions were within the scope of occupational therapy practice. Only studies determined to be Level I (i.e., randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, meta-analyses), Level II (i.e., nonrandomized clinical trials, cohort studies), and Level III (i.e., before&amp;ndash;after, one-group designs) evidence were included. Studies were excluded if they were published before 1990, were Level IV or Level V evidence, used purely qualitative methods, were not peer reviewed, used geriatric or pediatric interventions, or used interventions outside the scope of occupational therapy practice. Databases searched included the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), MEDLINE, PsycINFO, HealthSTAR, Alternative Medicine (AMED), Social Work Abstracts, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Database of Systemic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Effects, American College of Physicians (ACP) Journal Club, and OT Seeker.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An initial search was completed in conjunction with a research librarian at EKU. In addition, a medical librarian with experience in conducting systematic reviews completed a second search using a filter based on one developed at McMaster University. The list of 950 citations and abstracts from both searches was reviewed, and 145 potential articles were evaluated according to inclusion and exclusion criteria.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the academic partnership with MCG, an advisory group consisting of occupational therapy practitioners, educators (including MCG faculty) and researchers with expertise in mental health, AOTA staff, and a consultant to AOTA's Evidence-Based Practice (EBP) projects developed the focused question for the systematic review. The MCG team, with support from AOTA staff and the advisory group, developed a search strategy to include the population; inclusion and exclusion criteria; and key search terms based on the population, interventions, and outcomes using the same search terms developed by the EKU group. Articles included in the review met the following criteria: published in a peer-reviewed journal, limited to English language, participants had a diagnosis of severe mental illness and were between the ages of 18 and 65, and interventions were within the scope of occupational therapy practice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Only studies determined to be Level I, Level II, or Level III evidence were included. Studies were excluded if they were published before 1990, were Level IV or V evidence, used purely qualitative methods, were not peer reviewed, were limited to geriatric or pediatric populations, or used interventions outside the scope of occupational therapy practice. Databases searched included CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, HealthSTAR, AMED, Social Work Abstracts, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Database of Systemic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Effects, ACP Journal Club, and OT Seeker.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The search of the databases was completed by a medical librarian with experience in conducting systematic reviews using a filter based on one developed at McMaster University. Abstracts were sought for all citations from this review. All abstracts were downloaded into Zotero (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zotero.org&quot; title=&quot;Zotero Web site&quot;&gt;http://www.zotero.org&lt;/a&gt;), a free Web-based citation manager extension of Mozilla Firefox that was used to manage all abstracts and articles. All 1,964 abstracts identified by the search process were reviewed by at least three individuals working on the project using the inclusion/exclusion criteria described above. A total of 101 articles were acquired and assigned to individual reviewers. After further review, some of the articles were found to not meet the inclusion criteria and were excluded from the final review. Additional articles were identified from reviews of reference lists and hand searches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="136" OrdBy="415" ID="408" Name="Number of Source Documents" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 96 articles were included in the review of the two focused questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="115" OrdBy="420" ID="409" Name="Methods Used to Assess the Quality and Strength of the Evidence" Type="picklist-choice"><FieldValue Value="Weighting According to a Rating Scheme (Scheme Given)" /></Field><Field FieldID="149" OrdBy="425" ID="410" Name="Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Levels of Evidence for Occupational Therapy Outcomes Research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;3&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; summary=&quot;Levels of Evidence for Occupational Therapy Outcomes Research&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;thead&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;tr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;th valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Levels of Evidence&lt;/th&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;th valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Definitions&lt;/th&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;/tr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/thead&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;tbody&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;tr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;th valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Level I&lt;/th&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials&lt;/td&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;/tr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;tr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;th valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Level II&lt;/th&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Two groups, nonrandomized studies (e.g., cohort, case-control)&lt;/td&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;/tr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;tr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;th valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Level III&lt;/th&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;One group, nonrandomized (e.g., before and after, pretest and posttest)&lt;/td&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;/tr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;tr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;th valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Level IV&lt;/th&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Descriptive studies that include analysis of outcomes (e.g., single-subject design, case series)&lt;/td&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;/tr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;tr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;th valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Level V&lt;/th&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Case reports and expert opinion that include narrative literature reviews and consensus statements&lt;/td&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;/tr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/tbody&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/table&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p class=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: Adapted from &quot;Evidence-based medicine: What it is and what it isn't.&quot; D.

A Critically Appraised Topic (CAT) further summarized and synthesized the information, and both the evidence table and CAT were submitted to AOTA staff and the project consultant for review. The students presented on the review process and the AOTA collaboration as a component of requirements for their master's project. A total of 46 articles were selected for final analysis in the review. Of those, 37 were Level I studies, 5 were Level II studies, and 4 were Level III studies (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence&quot; field).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the academic partnership with MCG, the 50 articles that met all inclusion criteria were analyzed and critically appraised and summarized in an evidence table. A CAT further summarized and synthesized the information, and both the evidence table and CAT were submitted to AOTA staff and the project consultant for review.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thirty-one of the articles included in the review were Level I studies, 13 were Level II studies, and 6 were Level III studies. The evidence table of all articles included in both reviews can be found in Appendix C of the original guideline document. A total of 96 articles were included in the review of the two focused questions. Although the review included published literature from occupational therapy as well as related fields, all studies provided evidence within the scope of occupational therapy practice. Sixty-seven (71%) of the articles were at Level I, and 85 (89%) of the articles were at Level I or Level II, indicating that the review incorporated evidence at the highest levels.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Limitations in several of the studies incorporated into the review included lack of randomization, lack of a control group, small sample size, lack of blinding of researcher to treatment allocation, limited follow-up, and sampling bias. In several studies, the dropout rate by participants was large and may not have been documented. In addition, several studies did not describe the experimental and control conditions, and in others, the intervention and comparison groups varied with respect to intensity of intervention. In some studies, the validity of the outcome measure was not reported, and in several, the outcome measures were similar to the intervention. The definition or description of occupational therapy programs also varied from study to study. Generalization of results of a number of studies was limited when a study was gender-specific or the study did not take place in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="112" OrdBy="440" ID="413" Name="Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations" Type="picklist-choice"><FieldValue Value="Expert Consensus" /></Field><Field FieldID="145" OrdBy="445" ID="414" Name="Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three Eastern Kentucky University (EKU) graduate students, one faculty advisor, and American Occupational Therapy Association (AOTA) project staff took part in the review.

Occupational therapy practitioners must be &quot;knowledgeable about evidence-based research and [apply] it ethically and appropriately to provide occupational therapy services consistent with best practice approaches.&quot; The following general recommendations are based on the evidence described in the original guideline (see the table below for more specific recommendations):&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Individuals with severe mental illness are able to acquire and maintain new knowledge and skills. Occupational therapy interventions should identify the specific knowledge and skills that are needed for an individual to succeed in the areas of occupation in which he or she needs or wants to succeed. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Knowledge and skills-training outcomes are improved when the intervention is individualized, presented in a manner that is relevant and applicable to daily life, and incorporates training over an extended period of time (i.e., months as opposed to days or weeks). &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Client-centered practices that incorporate choice and collaboration promote better outcomes. Occupational therapists should seek input and create initial treatment plans that are based on the desires of the individual client. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Improvements are most likely to occur in areas that are most proximal to the intervention; for example, cognitive interventions improve cognition, skills training results in improvements in the targeted skills, or supported employment most affects the client's ability to find a job. It is less likely that generalizability of skills will occur without specific efforts toward that effect. For example, cognitive interventions generally do not result in occupational performance improvements unless they specifically target the occupation (e.g., cognitive-skills training incorporated in work or social-skills training). Occupational therapists, then, should select the intervention that most closely targets the desired outcome. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Intervention in real-world environments is more effective than interventions that focus on pretraining or preliminary skill building; for example, the supported models (education and employment) indicate that pretraining is less effective than placement in actual work and educational settings and the training and support that are acquired in those real-world settings. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Adapting the environment is a useful approach for improving occupational performance in individuals with serious mental illness. For example, cognitive adaptation training and job accommodations compensate for cognitive, sensory, and other impairments that interfere with successful community living. Occupational therapists are skilled in adapting the environment and can use this approach for addressing all areas of occupation. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;br /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; summary=&quot;Table.
