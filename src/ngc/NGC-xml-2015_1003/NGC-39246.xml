Recently, reports of several prospective, randomized intervention trials have been published in this area, and the Task Force members are aware of large-scale prospective intervention trials that are ongoing. Nevertheless, in the last 20 years many high-quality studies have modified older dogmas and profoundly changed the ways in which these patients are managed.

An international Task Force was created under the auspices of The Endocrine Society to review the best evidence in the field and develop evidence-based guidelines, and a report was issued in 2007. Because of advances in the field, the committee was reconvened in 2009. The current Task Force also includes members of the Asia &amp;amp; Oceania Thyroid Association, European Thyroid Association, and the Latin American Thyroid Society.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Task Force was composed of a chair selected by the Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee of The Endocrine Society, experts appointed by The Endocrine Society, Asia &amp;amp; Oceania Thyroid Association, European Thyroid Association, and Latin American Thyroid Society, and a methodologist.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Task Force followed the approach of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to evaluate the strength of each recommendation and the quality of the evidence. The Task Force used the best available research evidence to develop the recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the USPSTF system, the strength of a recommendation is graded A, B, C, D, or I (if insufficient), and evidence is graded good, fair, or poor. In the GRADE system strong recommendations use the number 1, and weak recommendations use the number 2. The Task Force has confidence that persons who receive care according to the strong recommendations will derive, on average, more good than harm. Weak recommendations require more careful consideration of the person's circumstances, values, and preferences to determine the best course of action. Linked to each recommendation is a description of the evidence and the values that panelists considered in making the recommendation; in some instances, there are remarks, a section in which panelists offer technical suggestions for testing conditions, dosing, and monitoring. These technical comments reflect the best available evidence applied to a typical person being treated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consensus Process&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The guideline was developed through a series of e-mails, conference calls, and one face-to-face meeting. An initial draft was prepared by the Task Force, with the help of a medical writer, and reviewed and commented on by members of The Endocrine Society, Asia &amp;amp; Oceania Thyroid Association, and the Latin American Thyroid Society.

Therefore maternal hypothyroidism should be avoided.

In retrospective studies thyroxine treatment improved obstetrical outcome, but it has not been proved to modify long-term neurological development in the offspring. However, given that the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks, the panel recommends thyroxine replacement in women with SCH who are thyroid peroxidase antibody positive (TPO-Ab+).

(USPSTF Recommendation level: C, Evidence-poor) (2|+OOO)&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The thyroxine dose usually needs to be incremented by four to six weeks gestation and may require a 30% or more increase in dosage. (USPSTF Recommendation level: A, Evidence-good) (1|++++)&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If overt hypothyroidism is diagnosed during pregnancy, thyroid function tests should be normalized as rapidly as possible. Thyroxine dosage should be titrated to rapidly reach and thereafter maintain serum TSH concentrations of less than 2.5 mIU/L (in an assay using the International Standard) in the first trimester (or 3 mIU/L in second and third trimester) or to trimester-specific TSH ranges. Thyroid function tests should be remeasured within 30&amp;ndash;40 days and then every four to six weeks. (USPSTF Recommendation level: A, Evidence-good) (1|++++)&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Women with thyroid autoimmunity who are euthyroid in the early stages of pregnancy are at risk of developing hypothyroidism and should be monitored every four to six weeks for elevation of TSH above the normal range for pregnancy. (USPSTF Recommendation level: A, Evidence-fair) (1|+++O)&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After delivery, most hypothyroid women need to decrease the thyroxine dosage they received during pregnancy to the pre-pregnancy dose.

Differentiation of Graves' disease from gestational thyrotoxicosis is supported by presence of clinical evidence of autoimmunity, a typical goiter, and presence of thyrotropin receptor antibodies (TRAb). TPO-Ab may be present in either case. (USPSTF Recommendation level: B, Evidence-fair) (1|+++O)&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For overt hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease or thyroid nodules, antithyroid drug (ATD) therapy should be either initiated (before pregnancy if possible, and for those with new diagnoses) or adjusted (for those with a prior history) to maintain the maternal thyroid hormone levels for free T&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; at or just above the upper limit of the non-pregnant reference range (USPSTF Recommendation level: B, Evidence-fair) (1|++OO) or maintaining total T&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; at one and a half times the upper limit of the normal reference range, or the free thyroxine index in the upper limit of the normal reference range. (USPSTF Recommendation level: I, Evidence-poor) (2|+OOO)&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Propylthiouracil (PTU), if available, is recommended as the first-line drug for treatment of hyperthyroidism during the first trimester of pregnancy because of the possible association of methimazole (MMI) with specific congenital abnormalities that occur during first trimester organogenesis. MMI may also be prescribed if PTU is not available or if a patient cannot tolerate or has an adverse response to PTU. Methimazole 10 mg is considered to be approximately equal to 100&amp;ndash;150 mg of propylthiouracil. Recent analyses reported by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) indicate that PTU may rarely be associated with severe liver toxicity. For this reason the Task Force recommends that clinicians change treatment of patients from PTU to MMI after the completion of the first trimester. Available data indicate that MMI and PTU are equally efficacious in treatment of pregnant women. Practitioners should use their clinical judgment in choosing the ATD therapy, including the potential difficulties involved in switching patients from one drug to another. If switching from PTU to MMI, thyroid function should be assessed after two weeks and then at two to four week intervals. (USPSTF Recommendation level: B, Evidence-fair) (1|++OO) Although liver toxicity may appear abruptly, it is reasonable to monitor liver function in pregnant women on PTU every three to four weeks and to encourage patients to promptly report any new symptoms. (USPSTF Recommendation level: C, Evidence-poor) (2|+OOO)&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Subtotal thyroidectomy may be indicated during pregnancy as therapy for maternal Graves' disease if (i) a patient has a severe adverse reaction to ATD therapy, (ii) persistently high doses of ATD are required (over 30 mg/day of methimazole or 450 mg/day of PTU), or (iii) a patient is nonadherent to ATD therapy and has uncontrolled hyperthyroidism. The optimal timing of surgery is in the second trimester. (USPSTF Recommendation level C, Evidence-fair) (2|+OOO)&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is no evidence that treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism improves pregnancy outcome, and treatment could potentially adversely affect fetal outcome. (USPSTF Recommendation level: C, Evidence-fair) (2|+OOO)&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Management of Maternal Hyperthyroidism: Fetal Aspects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since thyroid receptor antibodies (thyroid receptor stimulating, binding, or inhibiting antibodies) freely cross the placenta and can stimulate the fetal thyroid, these antibodies should be measured by 22 weeks gestational age in mothers with 1) current Graves' disease, or 2) a history of Graves' disease and treatment with &lt;sup&gt;131&lt;/sup&gt;I or thyroidectomy before pregnancy, or 3) a previous neonate with Graves' disease, or 4) previously elevated TRAb. Women who have a negative TRAb and do not require ATD have a very low risk of fetal or neonatal thyroid dysfunction. (USPSTF Recommendation level: B, Evidence-fair) (1|+++O)&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;131&lt;/sup&gt;I should not be given to a woman who is or may be pregnant. If inadvertently treated, the patient should be promptly informed of the radiation danger to the fetus, including thyroid destruction if treated after the 12th week of gestation. (USPSTF Recommendation level: A, Evidence-good) (1|+++O) There are no data for or against recommending termination of pregnancy after &lt;sup&gt;131&lt;/sup&gt;I exposure. (USPSTF Recommendation level: I, Evidence-poor) (2|+OOO)&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In women with TRAb or thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) elevated at least two- to three-fold the normal level, and in women treated with ATD, maternal free T&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and fetal thyroid dysfunction should be screened for during the fetal anatomy ultrasound done in the 18th&amp;ndash;22nd week and repeated every four to six weeks or as clinically indicated. Evidence of fetal thyroid dysfunction could include thyroid enlargement, growth restriction, hydrops, presence of goiter, advanced bone age, tachycardia or cardiac failure. If fetal hyperthyroidism is diagnosed and thought to endanger the pregnancy, treatment using MMI or PTU should be given with frequent clinical, laboratory and U.S. monitoring. (USPSTF Recommendation level: B, Evidence-fair) (1|+++O)&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Umbilical blood sampling should be considered only if the diagnosis of fetal thyroid disease is not reasonably certain from the clinical and sonographic data, and the information gained would change the treatment. (USPSTF Recommendation level: B, Evidence-fair) (2|+OOO)&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All newborns of mothers with Graves' disease (except those with negative TRAb and not requiring ATD) should be evaluated by a medical care provider for thyroid dysfunction and treated if necessary.

Universal screening for antithyroid antibodies, and possible treatment, cannot be recommended at this time. As of January 2011, only one randomized interventional trial has suggested a decrease in the first trimester miscarriage rate in euthyroid antibody-positive women, but treatment duration was very brief before the outcome of interest. However, since women with elevated anti-TPO antibodies are at increased risk for progression of hypothyroidism, if identified such women should be screened for serum TSH abnormalities before pregnancy, as well as during the first and second trimesters of pregnancy.

Women with nodules 5 mm&amp;ndash;1 cm in size should be considered for FNA if they have a high risk history or suspicious findings on ultrasound, and women with complex nodules 1.5&amp;ndash;2 cm or larger should also receive an FNA. During the last weeks of pregnancy, FNA can reasonably be delayed until after delivery. Ultrasound-guided FNA is likely to have an advantage for maximizing adequate sampling. (USPSTF Recommendation level: B, Evidence-fair) (1|+++O)&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When nodules discovered in the first or early second trimester are found to be malignant or highly suspicious on cytopathologic analysis, to exhibit rapid growth, or to be accompanied by pathologic neck adenopathy, pregnancy need not be interrupted, but surgery should be offered in the second trimester. Women found to have cytology indicative of papillary cancer or follicular neoplasm without evidence of advanced disease, and who prefer to wait until the postpartum period for definitive surgery, may be reassured that most well-differentiated thyroid cancers are slow growing and that delaying surgical treatment soon after delivery is unlikely to change disease-specific survival. (USPSTF Recommendation level: B, Evidence-fair) (1|++OO)&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is appropriate to administer thyroid hormone to achieve a suppressed but detectable TSH in pregnant women with a previously treated thyroid cancer, in those with an FNA positive for or suspicious for cancer, or in those who elect to delay surgical treatment until postpartum. High risk patients may benefit more than low risk patients from a greater degree of TSH suppression. The free T&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; or total T&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; levels should ideally not be increased above the normal range for pregnancy. (USPSTF Recommendation level: I, Evidence-poor) (2|+OOO)&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Radioactive iodine (RAI) with &lt;sup&gt;131&lt;/sup&gt;I should not be given to women who are breastfeeding or for at least four weeks after nursing has ceased. (USPSTF Recommendation level: A, Evidence-good) (1|++++) Furthermore, pregnancy should be avoided for six months to one year in women with thyroid cancer who receive therapeutic RAI doses to ensure stability of thyroid function and confirm remission of thyroid cancer.

As long before pregnancy as possible, during pregnancy and breastfeeding, women should increase their daily iodine intake to 250 &amp;mu;g on average. (USPSTF Recommendation level: A, Evidence-good) (1|+++O)&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Iodine intake during pregnancy and breastfeeding should not exceed twice the daily recommended nutrient intake (RNI) for iodine, i.e., 500 &amp;mu;g iodine per day. (USPSTF Recommendation level: I, Evidence-poor) (2|+OOO)&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While not advised as a part of normal clinical practice, the adequacy of the iodine intake during pregnancy can be assessed by measuring urinary iodine concentration (UIC) in a representative cohort of the population. UIC should ideally range between 150 and 250 &amp;mu;g/L. If there is significant concern, the care-giver should assay TSH and thyroid hormone levels. (USPSTF Recommendation level: A, Evidence-good) (1|++++)&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To reach the daily recommended nutrient intake for iodine, multiple means must be considered, tailored to the iodine intake level in a given population. Different situations must therefore be distinguished: a) countries with iodine sufficiency and/or with a well-established universal salt iodization (USI) program, b) countries without a USI program or with an established USI program where the coverage is known to be only partial, and c) remote areas with no accessible USI program and difficult socioeconomic conditions. (USPSTF Recommendation level: A, Evidence-good) (1|++++)&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Task Force recommends that once-daily prenatal vitamins contain 150&amp;ndash;200 &amp;mu;g iodine and that this be in the form of potassium iodide or iodate, the content of which is verified to ensure that all pregnant women taking prenatal vitamins are protected from iodine deficiency. Ideally, supplementation should be started before conception. Preparations containing iron supplements should be separated from thyroid hormone administration by at least four hours (USPSTF Recommendation level: B, Evidence-fair) (2|++OO)&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Task Force recommends that breastfeeding women maintain a daily intake of 250 &amp;mu;g of iodine to ensure breast milk provides 100 &amp;mu;g iodine per day to the infant.

(USPSTF Recommendation level: I, Evidence-poor) (2|+OOO)&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Women known to be TPO-Ab-positive should have a TSH performed at six to twelve weeks and at six months postpartum, or as clinically indicated. (USPSTF Recommendation level: A, Evidence-good) (1|+++O)&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because the prevalence of PPT in women with type 1 diabetes, Graves' disease in remission, and chronic viral hepatitis is greater than in the general population, screening by TSH is recommended at three and six months postpartum. (USPSTF Recommendation level: B, Evidence-fair) (2|++OO)&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Women with a history of PPT have a markedly increased risk of developing permanent primary hypothyroidism in the five- to ten-year period following the episode of PPT. An annual TSH level should be performed in these women. (USPSTF Recommendation level: A, Evidence-good) (1|+++O)&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Asymptomatic women with PPT who have a TSH above the reference range but less than 10 mIU/L and who are not planning a subsequent pregnancy do not necessarily require intervention, but should, if untreated, be re-monitored in four to eight weeks. When a TSH above the reference range continues, women should be treated with levothyroxine. Symptomatic women and women with a TSH above normal and who are attempting pregnancy should be treated with levothyroxine. (USPSTF Recommendation level: B, Evidence-fair) (2|++OO)&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is insufficient evidence to conclude whether an association exists between postpartum depression (PPD) and either PPT or thyroid antibody positivity (in women who did not develop PPT). (USPSTF Recommendation level: I, Evidence-poor) (2|+OOO) However, as hypothyroidism is a potentially reversible cause of depression, women with PPD should be screened for hypothyroidism and appropriately treated.

(USPSTF Recommendation level: I, Evidence-poor) (2|+OOO)&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, caregivers should identify individuals at 'high risk' for thyroid illness (Table 8, Section 8 in the original guideline) on the basis of their medical history, physical exam, or prior biochemical data. When such individuals are identified, prenatal measurement of serum TSH is recommended. If above 2.5 mIU/L, the test should be confirmed by repeat assay. While no RCTs are available to guide a response, the committee believes it is appropriate to give low-dose T&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; treatment to bring TSH below 2.5 mIU/L. This treatment can be discontinued if the woman does not become pregnant, or postpartum. (USPSTF Recommendation level: I, Evidence-poor) (2|+OOO)&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All women considering pregnancy with known thyroid dysfunction and receiving levothyroxine should be tested for abnormal TSH concentrations before pregnancy. (USPSTF Recommendation level: B, Evidence-fair) (1|++OO)&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If hypothyroidism has been diagnosed before pregnancy, we recommend adjustment of the preconception thyroxine dose to reach prior to pregnancy a TSH level not higher than 2.5 mIU/L. (USPSTF Recommendation level: C, Evidence-fair) (2|++OO)&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All women receiving levothyroxine should be verbally screened prenatally to assess their understanding of changing levothyroxine requirements following conception. These women should be counseled to contact a physician or medical professional immediately upon a missed menstrual cycle or suspicion of pregnancy to check their serum TSH level. An additional recommendation may be to increase their levothyroxine dose by 30%, which is often two additional tablets per week (nine tablets/week instead of seven tablets/week), until their serum TSH can be checked. (USPSTF Recommendation level: B, Evidence-fair) (2|++OO)&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Universal screening for the presence of anti-TPO antibodies either before or during pregnancy is not recommended. (USPSTF Recommendation level: C, Evidence level-fair) (2|+OOO)&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, women with elevated anti-TPO antibodies are at increased risk for miscarriage, preterm delivery, progression of hypothyroidism, and PPT. Therefore, if identified, such women should be screened for serum TSH abnormalities before pregnancy, as well as during the first and second trimesters of pregnancy. (USPSTF Recommendation level: C, Evidence-fair) (1|++OO) (See also below.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The committee could not reach agreement with regard to screening recommendations for all newly pregnant women. Two versions are therefore presented.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some members recommended screening of all pregnant women for serum TSH abnormalities by the ninth week or at the time of their first visit. (USPSTF Recommendation level: C, Evidence-fair) (2|++OO)&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some members recommended neither for nor against universal screening of all pregnant women for TSH abnormalities at the time of their first visit. These members strongly support aggressive case finding to identify and test high-risk women (see Table 8, Section 8, in the original guideline doucment) for elevated TSH concentrations by the ninth week or at the time of their first visit before and during pregnancy, and recognize in some situations, ascertainment of the individual's risk status may not be feasible. In such cases, and where the local practice environment is appropriate, testing of all women by nine weeks of pregnancy or at the first prenatal visit is reasonable. (USPSTF Recommendation level: I, Evidence-poor) (2|+OOO)&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If serum TSH is &amp;gt;2.5 mIU/L at the time of testing (or &amp;gt;3.0 mIU/L in the second trimester), levothyroxine therapy should be instituted. For overt hypothyroidism: (USPSTF Recommendation level: A, Evidence-good) (1|++++); for subclinical hypothyroidism and obstetrical outcome: (USPSTF Recommendation level: C, Evidence-fair) (2|+OOO); for subclinical hypothyroidism and neurological outcome: (USPSTF Recommendation level: C, Evidence level-poor) (2|+OOO)&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If TSH concentration is 2.5&amp;ndash;10 mIU/L, a starting levothyroxine dose of 50 mcg/day or more is recommended. Other thyroid preparations (such as triiodothyronine) are not recommended. (USPSTF Recommendation level: C, Evidence level-fair) (2|++OO)&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Women at high-risk for PPT in the postpartum months should be screened via assessment of serum TSH. These high-risk groups include: 1) women known to be TPO-Ab+, 2) women with type 1 diabetes, and 3) women with a prior history of PPT. Screening should occur at six to twelve weeks postpartum. Women with Graves' disease who enter remission during pregnancy should be screened for recurrence by TSH assay at three to six months.

For this reason it is recommended that clinicians change treatment of patients from PTU to methimazole (MMI) after the completion of the first trimester. MMI can also damage the liver, but this damage is characterized by a cholestatic picture rather than the hepatocellular injury associated with PTU.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Treatment of maternal subclinical hyperthyroidism has not been found to improve pregnancy outcome and may risk unnecessary exposure of the fetus to antithyroid drugs (ATDs). &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;ATDs are associated with side effects such as agranulocytosis.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;There have been reports of two distinct teratogenic patterns associated with MMI: aplasia cutis and choanal/esophageal atresia.

Exposure after 12 weeks can induce thyroid ablation, requiring intrauterine thyroid hormone replacement and lifelong therapy for hypothyroidism. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;If surgery is elected in pregnancy, it is best avoided in the first and third trimesters. During the first trimester, there is concern over the possible teratogenic effects on the fetus, and surgery of any type is associated with increased early fetal loss. Surgery of any type in the third trimester is associated with a higher incidence of preterm labor.
