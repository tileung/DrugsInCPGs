These lists were based on the evolution of the science, public comment received, and whether controversy existed about a given topic or guideline. After developing an initial list of research questions, the subcommittees set priorities for questions to be answered using the Nutrition Evidence Library (NEL) systematic review methodology. The wording and intent of specific questions evolved and additional questions were considered in an iterative process. Frequently, multiple questions were needed to fully address a topic of interest. This cluster of questions was referred to as a &quot;family of questions.&quot; Limitations in time and resources prevented the review of all questions using the NEL systematic review methodology.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As needed, NEL staff conducted exploratory literature searches and developed analytical frameworks to assist Committee members in framing NEL systematic review questions. The scope of topic areas addressed was very broad, so subcommittee members were required to make critical decisions related to the comprehensiveness of reviews, such as determining literature search date ranges. Any available systematic reviews (e.g., 2009 Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality [AHRQ] report &lt;em&gt;Vitamin D and Calcium: A Systematic Review of Health Outcomes)&lt;/em&gt; or reports based on systematic reviews (e.g., &lt;em&gt;Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee Report, 2008&lt;/em&gt;) that were deemed to be current and comprehensive representations of available literature were not duplicated by the NEL team. Results from the 2007 &lt;em&gt;World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research; Food, Nutrition, Physical Activity, and the Prevention of Cancer: A Global Perspective&lt;/em&gt; report were used to substantiate recommendations related to food, nutrient, and diet intake and cancer-related outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Literature Search and Sort Plans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A method, referred to as PICO, was used to identify the Population or Participants, Intervention (or Exposure in observational studies), Comparator, and Outcomes of interest to be addressed by a specific question or family of questions. The PICO method aided the generation of a literature search and sort plan, which defined the eligibility criteria for studies selected for inclusion in each systematic review. All searches were limited to human studies, developed countries, English language, and peer-reviewed publications. Unpublished data, including abstracts and conference proceedings, were not included. General eligibility criteria included factors, such as:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Age &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Health status of subjects (inclusion of subjects with type 2 diabetes or other prevalent chronic diseases varied by topic) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Study setting &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Number of subjects per study arm (typically a minimum of 10 subjects per study arm) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Attrition rate (typically less than 20 percent; rate was modified for long-term studies) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Characteristics of the intervention (e.g., dose or duration of intervention, food based nutrients) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Outcome measures and timing of measures &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Study design &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The subcommittees tailored inclusion and exclusion criteria by question or family of questions. Each subcommittee carefully considered the date range from which to extract the evidence, based upon whether the systematic review was designed to update 2005 &lt;em&gt;Dietary Guidelines&lt;/em&gt;, update a comprehensive systematic review, or examine an area not previously addressed by the &lt;em&gt;Dietary Guidelines&lt;/em&gt;. Many searches initially included all study designs. However, for a number of questions, cross-sectional studies were eventually excluded from review when sufficient evidence from studies with a stronger design was available.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Existing systematic reviews were frequently incorporated into the portfolio of evidence used to answer a question. Comprehensive systematic reviews, with well-documented methodology and rigorous criteria for judging methodological quality of included studies and grading the body of evidence, were occasionally selected to serve as a baseline for a review in cases where the seminal research on a question was considered to be &quot;settled science.&quot; Numerous published systematic reviews conducted by the American Dietetic Association were updated for this report, using DGAC criteria.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The committee used an iterative, step-wise process to determine which research designs were considered to examine a question. Study designs included intervention trials, observational studies, ecological studies, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses. If systematic reviews were used, primary studies included in these reviews were excluded. If multiple systematic reviews considered an overlapping body of primary studies, this was noted in the evidence summary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Each search and sort plan specified the databases and search terms used to guide the search. PubMed/Medline and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched for all of the NEL systematic review questions, supplemented by BIOSIS, CAB Abstracts, Food Science &amp;amp; Technology Abstracts, Scopus, ScienceDirect, Embase, Aquatic Sciences and Fisheries Abstracts, Fish and Fisheries Worldwide, and AGRICOLA, as dictated by the question topics. A wide variety of search terms and key words were used, including subject headings such as MeSH and thesauri terms. Because some databases do not have full text search capabilities, key word/subject terms searches were limited to certain fields (e.g., titles and abstracts), which may have limited identification of potentially relevant articles.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Electronic searches were augmented by hand searches of references from primary and review articles, as well as articles identified for consideration by committee members. If new search terms were identified, the electronic searches were rerun to ensure completeness of the search. The Committee monitored the search process including review of the search terms and results. The search was expanded or modified based on their feedback and knowledge of the field.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selecting the Evidence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The literature search plan was implemented collaboratively by the research librarian, the NEL nutrition scientist staff, and the DGAC members. The research librarian conducted a title screen and identified abstracts to be reviewed by the NEL staff. All abstracts identified by the research librarian were evaluated by the NEL staff, in accordance with criteria outlined in the search and sort plan. Articles that potentially met the eligibility criteria were reviewed in full-text version. Two lists were compiled for review by subcommittee members: a list of citations meeting the inclusion criteria and a list of citations recommended for exclusion (with the specific rationale for exclusion noted). When an article could not be clearly included or excluded based on the eligibility criteria, it was highlighted for subcommittee review.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once the subcommittee reached agreement on the final list of articles to be included in the review, the NEL staff assigned each included manuscript to a National Service Volunteer to prepare an evidence worksheet. Information on the search terms used, search date, number of included and excluded citations identified by the search, final list of included citations, and a table with the excluded citations, including reason for exclusion, are provided in the NEL, at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nutritionevidencelibrary.com&quot; title=&quot;Nutrition Evidence Library Web site&quot;&gt;www.nutritionevidencelibrary.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="136" OrdBy="415" ID="408" Name="Number of Source Documents" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not stated&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="115" OrdBy="420" ID="409" Name="Methods Used to Assess the Quality and Strength of the Evidence" Type="picklist-choice"><FieldValue Value="Expert Consensus" /><FieldValue Value="Weighting According to a Rating Scheme (Scheme Given)" /></Field><Field FieldID="149" OrdBy="425" ID="410" Name="Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Strength of the Evidence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong evidence&lt;/strong&gt; reflects consistent, convincing findings derived from studies with robust methodology relevant to the population of interest.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moderate evidence&lt;/strong&gt; reflects somewhat less evidence or less consistent evidence.

They: (1) classified the study by design type; (2) extracted key evidence from each individual study into a comprehensive, templated evidence worksheet (made available to committee members and posted on the Nutrition Evidence Library [NEL]); and (3) applied predefined criteria from Research Design and Implementation Checklists for each primary research study and review study to critically appraise the methodological quality of the study. Evidence abstractors received training on how to apply the criteria to studies differing in design.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Each study received a quality rating of positive, neutral, or negative, based upon a predefined scoring system (these quality grades are available for each article in the NEL). In the chapter text, for clarity, these ratings are described as studies which are methodologically strong (positive), methodologically neutral (neutral), and methodologically weak (negative). The appraisal of study quality is a critical component of the systematic review methodology because in a highly transparent manner, it indicates the Committee's judgment regarding the relevance (external validity/generalizability) and validity of each study's results. This rating, referred to as the &quot;quality rating,&quot; indicates the extent to which the design and conduct of a study is shown to be protected from systematic bias, nonsystematic bias, and inferential error. Studies were not excluded on the basis of quality rating. However, the quality rating was taken into consideration by the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) as they reviewed the literature and formed conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summaries of the Evidence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The NEL staff drafted evidence summary paragraphs and evidence tables for all included articles on a question or family of questions to aid analysis and synthesis of the complete body of evidence. These paragraphs and tables provided key information about the study design, quality rating, study subjects, the intervention or exposure, comparators, and key outcomes. Using this information, and going back to the original articles when necessary, Committee members then drafted an evidence overview summary, which included an overall summary statement, comparison of findings between studies, discussion of relevant issues related to methodologies used, and definitions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Formulating and Grading the Conclusion Statement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The final step in the DGAC's systematic review process was writing and grading a Conclusion statement, based upon the body of scientific evidence evaluated. This step was characterized by careful consideration of the qualitative and quantitative findings. Each Conclusion statement briefly answered the research question, focusing on the general agreement among studies. When the evidence addressed only one sex, age group, ethnicity, or level of health risk, such as children or subjects without cardiovascular disease, this was reflected in the Conclusion statement. Conclusions also included a statement regarding distinct subgroups, if findings for that population were different than for the overall conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Developing and grading each Conclusion was a deliberative and time-consuming process that benefited from group interaction. The strength of the evidence supporting the conclusion statement was graded using the DGAC's predetermined criteria, which assessed the quality (relevance and validity) and size of the studies, the quantity of studies, the consistency and agreement across studies, the generalizability to the population of interest, and the magnitude of the effect or public health impact. Each subcommittee deliberated on each Conclusion statement and grade, and proposed Conclusions and grades were then brought to the full Committee for consideration and discussion. Due to the challenge of grading such a broad range of conclusions within one report, the Committee decided to use the following qualitative word grades rather than numerical grades: Strong; Moderate; Limited; Expert Opinion; Grade Not Assignable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For some research questions, the DGAC's systematic review generated recommendations for future research.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food Patterns for Special Analyses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The 2010 DGAC identified specific questions that they felt could best be addressed through a food pattern modeling approach, using the USDA food patterns and the modeling process developed to address similar requests by the 2005 DGAC.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Briefly, the USDA food patterns describe types and amounts of food to consume that will provide a nutritionally satisfactory diet. They include recommended intakes for five major food groups and for subgroups within several of the groups. They also recommend an allowance for intake of oils and limits on intake of calories from solid fats and added sugars. The calories and nutrients that would be expected from consuming a specified amount from each component of the patterns are determined by calculating nutrient profiles. A nutrient profile is the consumption-weighted average nutrient content for nutrient-dense forms of foods within each group. These nutrient profiles can be modified based on the assumptions for each food pattern modeling analysis. Additional details on the USDA food patterns can be found in the report for the food pattern modeling analysis, Adequacy of the USDA Food Patterns, which is available at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dietaryguidelines.gov&quot; title=&quot;Dietary Guidelines Web site&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;www.dietaryguidelines.gov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A food pattern modeling process was developed for and used by the 2005 DGAC to determine the hypothetical impact on nutrients in and adequacy of the food patterns when specific changes are made. The structure of the USDA food patterns allows for modifications that test the overall impact on diet quality of various dietary recommendation scenarios. Most analyses involved identifying the impact of specific changes in amounts or types of foods that might be recommended by the Committee or selected by consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Five 2010 DGAC subcommittees identified a total of 18 questions that they felt could be addressed through food pattern modeling. Several questions were merged or dropped, resulting in 12 modeling analyses that were completed and provided as reports to the relevant subcommittees. For each question, a specific approach was drafted by USDA staff and provided to the subcommittee for comment. After the approach was discussed and accepted, USDA staff completed the analytical work and drafted a full report for the subcommittee's consideration. Each report was discussed by the relevant subcommittee, and the analysis and report were revised as needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="112" OrdBy="440" ID="413" Name="Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations" Type="picklist-choice"><FieldValue Value="Expert Consensus" /></Field><Field FieldID="145" OrdBy="445" ID="414" Name="Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Committee Appointment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Beginning with the 1985 edition, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) have appointed a Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) of prominent experts in nutrition and health to assist in preparing the &lt;em&gt;Dietary Guidelines for Americans&lt;/em&gt;. This Committee has been an effective mechanism for obtaining a comprehensive review of the science, recommendations from experts, and broad public acceptance of the &lt;em&gt;Dietary Guidelines&lt;/em&gt;. The 2010 DGAC was established for the single, time-limited task of reviewing the 2005 edition of &lt;em&gt;Nutrition and Your Health: Dietary Guidelines for Americans&lt;/em&gt; and determining whether, on the basis of current scientific and medical knowledge, revision was warranted. The Committee determined that a revision was needed and developed nutrition and health recommendations in this Advisory Report to the Secretaries of USDA and HHS. The Committee was dissolved upon delivery of this report.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Committee Process&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The 13-member Committee served without pay and worked under the regulations of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA). The Committee held six public meetings in Washington, DC over the course of 1&amp;frac12; years. Meetings were held in October 2008; January, April, and November 2009; and April and May 2010. Members of the general public were able to attend the Committee's first two meetings in person in Washington, DC. For the remaining meetings, members of the public were able to participate by webinar. All meetings were announced in the &lt;em&gt;Federal Register&lt;/em&gt;. Meeting minutes and transcripts were posted for each meeting at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dietaryguidelines.gov&quot; title=&quot;Dietary Guidelines Web site&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;www.dietaryguidelines.gov&lt;/a&gt;. Archived recordings of the third through sixth meetings were made available at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dietaryguidelines.gov&quot; title=&quot;Dietary Guidelines Web site&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;www.dietaryguidelines.gov&lt;/a&gt;. All documents pertaining to Committee deliberations were made available for public viewing at the first two meetings, and thereafter, were made available through &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dietaryguidelines.gov&quot; title=&quot;Dietary Guidelines Web site&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;www.dietaryguidelines.gov&lt;/a&gt; and at the National Agricultural Library Reference Desk.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Written public comments were received throughout the Committee's deliberations through a newly developed electronic database designed for collecting public comments. This database allowed for the generation of public comment reports as a result of a query by key topic areas. Comments received on and before April 29, 2010, were compiled into these reports and shared with all Committee members. A general description of the types of comments received and the process used for collecting public comments is described in &lt;em&gt;Appendix E-5. Public Comments&lt;/em&gt; of the &lt;em&gt;Report of the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2010&lt;/em&gt; (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field). Comments can be viewed by the public at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dietaryguidelines.gov&quot; title=&quot;Dietary Guidelines Web site&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;www.dietaryguidelines.gov&lt;/a&gt;. In response to a solicitation for oral comments, 51 of the 58 organizations or individuals who registered presented oral testimony during the January 29-30, 2009, meeting of the Committee. These comments are summarized in the January Public Meeting Minutes at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dietaryguidelines.gov&quot; title=&quot;Dietary Guielines Web site&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;www.dietaryguidelines.gov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Committee used a newly developed, state-of-the-art, web-based electronic system and methodology to address the majority of the science-based research questions posed by the Committee. These reviews are publicly available in the Nutrition Evidence Library (NEL) at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nutritionevidencelibrary.com&quot; title=&quot;Nutrition Evidence Library Web site&quot;&gt;www.nutritionevidencelibrary.com&lt;/a&gt;. Remaining questions were answered by data analyses, modeling analyses, and consideration of other evidence-based reviews or existing reports, such as the 2008 edition of the &lt;em&gt;Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans&lt;/em&gt;. Topic areas that were addressed for this report were similar to those for the 2005 &lt;em&gt;Dietary Guidelines&lt;/em&gt;, but this new methodology and web-based system allowed the Committee to ask and process more questions in a systematic, transparent, evidence-based manner. These research questions were developed and assessed by seven subcommittees: Energy Balance and Weight Management; Nutrient Adequacy; Fatty Acids and Cholesterol; Carbohydrates and Protein; Sodium, Potassium, and Water; Alcohol (initially called Ethanol); and Food Safety and Technology. One main difference from 2005 was that protein was added as a topic area, thus resulting in the Carbohydrates and Protein subcommittee. Food technology was also added as a topic area and was incorporated into the Food Safety and Technology subcommittee. Each subcommittee was made up of three to five Committee members, with one Committee member appointed as the lead. Although the lead member was responsible for communicating and coordinating all the work that needed to be accomplished within the subcommittees, draft conclusions reached on the scientific evidence reviewed, ultimately reflected the consensus of the entire Committee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For more information on the committee process, refer to the &quot;Methodology&quot; section of the &lt;em&gt;Report of the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2010&lt;/em&gt; (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="146" OrdBy="450" ID="415" Name="Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not applicable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="148" OrdBy="460" ID="417" Name="Cost Analysis" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A formal cost analysis was not performed and published cost analyses were not reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="104" OrdBy="465" ID="418" Name="Method of Guideline Validation" Type="picklist-choice"><FieldValue Value="External Peer Review" /></Field><Field FieldID="130" OrdBy="470" ID="419" Name="Description of Method of Guideline Validation" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written public comments were received throughout the Committee's deliberations through a newly developed electronic database designed for collecting public comments.

The 1,500 mg recommendation applies to about half of the U.S. population, including children, and the majority of adults. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Consume less than 10 percent of calories from saturated fatty acids by replacing them with monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Consume less than 300 mg per day of dietary cholesterol. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Keep trans fatty acid consumption as low as possible by limiting foods that contain synthetic sources of trans fats, such as partially hydrogenated oils, and by limiting other solid fats. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Reduce the intake of calories from solid fats and added sugars. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Limit the consumption of foods that contain refined grains, especially refined grain foods that contain solid fats, added sugars, and sodium. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;If alcohol is consumed, it should be consumed in moderation&amp;mdash;up to one drink per day for women and two drinks per day for men&amp;mdash;and only by adults of legal drinking age.* &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p class=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;* See Chapter 3 in the original guideline document, Foods and Food Components to Reduce, for additional recommendations on alcohol consumption and specific population groups.

For example, the Federal Government uses the Dietary Guidelines in developing nutrition assistance programs such as the National Child Nutrition Programs and the Elderly Nutrition Program. The Dietary Guidelines also provide the foundation for the Healthy People national health promotion and disease prevention objectives related to nutrition, which set measurable targets for achievement over a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Development of Authoritative Statements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2010&lt;/em&gt; has the potential to offer authoritative statements as a basis for health and nutrient content claims, as provided for in the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act (FDAMA). Potential authoritative statements should be phrased in a manner that enables consumers to understand the claim in the context of the total daily diet. FDAMA upholds the &quot;significant scientific agreement&quot; standard for authorized health claims. By law, this standard is based on the totality of publicly available scientific evidence. Therefore, for FDAMA purposes, statements based on, for example, evidence that is moderate, limited, inconsistent, emerging, or growing, are not authoritative statements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="117" OrdBy="1015" ID="437" Name="Implementation Tools" Type="picklist-many"><FieldValue Value="Foreign Language Translations" /><FieldValue Value="Patient Resources" /><FieldValue Value="Quick Reference Guides/Physician Guides" /><FieldValue Value="Resources" /><FieldValue Value="Slide Presentation" /><FieldValue Value="Staff Training/Competency Material" /></Field></Section><Section SecID="439" OrdBy="1100" Name="Institute of Medicine (IOM) National Healthcare Quality Report Categories"><Field FieldID="50" OrdBy="1105" ID="440" Name="IOM Care Need" Type="picklist-many"><FieldValue Value="Staying Healthy" /></Field><Field FieldID="51" OrdBy="1110" ID="441" Name="IOM Domain" Type="picklist-many"><FieldValue Value="Effectiveness" /><FieldValue Value="Patient-centeredness" /></Field></Section><Section SecID="442" OrdBy="1200" Name="Identifying Information and Availability"><Field FieldID="97" OrdBy="1201" ID="392" Name="Bibliographic Source(s)" Type="citation"><FieldValue Value="&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
