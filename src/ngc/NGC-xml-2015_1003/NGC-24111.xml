Duplicate entries were allowed to be removed by the inbuilt feature in Reference Manager and also removed when encountered by reviewers. Titles and abstracts were independently checked for relevance based on the population and intervention by two reviewers. If articles were considered relevant by at least one of the reviewers, a full paper copy was ordered.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Full papers were assessed for relevance by two independent reviewers using an inclusion/exclusion checklist (see Appendix 10.6 of the assessment report) based on the following criteria:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Population: a majority of adults with active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to a tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Intervention: adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab, rituximab, or abatacept &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Outcomes: clinical outcomes related to efficacy, safety or tolerability &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Study design: primary study (except case reports) or a systematic review &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Study duration: at least 12 weeks &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Participant numbers: for non-randomised studies - at least 20 patients in one arm &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Disagreements were resolved by discussion with involvement of a third reviewer when necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Conference abstracts were not sought. If they were identified as relevant in the first stage of study selection, an attempt was made to match them with journal publications. If this was not possible, contact with authors was not attempted due to time constraints and they were not included in the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A list of excluded studies and the reason for exclusion were recorded (see Appendix 10.4 of the assessment report).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Included systematic reviews were not themselves systematically reviewed but were utilised to identify further primary studies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Additional references identified from systematic reviews or industry submissions were entered into the Reference Manager database. The same process was applied to them as to the references identified from initial searches.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ongoing Studies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ongoing primary studies were identified in the searches.

Any disagreements were resolved by discussion and if necessary a third reviewer was consulted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For randomised trials, the following criteria were considered:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Randomisation &amp;ndash; whether allocation was truly random. Randomisation using computer or random number table was considered adequate whereas the use of alternation, case record numbers, or dates of birth and day of the week was considered inadequate. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Allocation concealment &amp;ndash; whether allocation concealment was adequate. Any of the following methods was considered adequate: centralised (e.g., allocation by a central office unaware of subject characteristics) or pharmacy-controlled randomisation; prenumbered or coded identical containers which are administered serially to participants; on-site computer system combined with allocations kept in a locked unreadable computer file that can be accessed only after the characteristics of an enrolled participant have been entered; sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Blinding &amp;ndash; use of blinding and who was blinded (patients, study investigators/outcome assessors, data analysts). &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Patients withdrawn &amp;ndash; what was the percentage of patients withdrawn from the study. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Intention to Treat (ITT) analysis &amp;ndash; whether ITT analysis was used. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For non-randomised studies, the following criteria were considered:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Study design &amp;ndash; if the study was controlled or uncontrolled, prospective or retrospective. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Inclusion criteria &amp;ndash; if inclusion criteria were clearly stated. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Consecutive patients &amp;ndash; if consecutive patients were included in the study. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Patients withdrawn &amp;ndash; what was the percentage of patients withdrawn from the study. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Analysis/Synthesis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Comparisons with Supportive Care&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Studies were considered separately for each of the interventions. In addition tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors were discussed together as a class of drugs. Results were presented in figures and discussed in the assessment report.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For dichotomous measures data is presented as relative risks (for randomised controlled trials [RCTs]) and percentages (for other study designs). For continuous outcomes mean differences (for RCTs) and means (for other study designs) were used.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pooling of results was not attempted for the assessment of effectiveness of individual technologies because the majority of included studies had no control group and there is substantial methodological and clinical heterogeneity between included studies. Given the relatively small number of patients that can be analysed in subgroup analyses, some pooling of data using random effects model was attempted. The results were presented with I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; statistics mainly for demonstrating consistency of findings between studies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Refer to Section 5 of the assessment report for more information.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Cost-Effectiveness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Systematic Review of Existing Cost-Effectiveness Evidence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Four studies met the inclusion criteria and the key features of these studies are summarised in Table 69 of the assessment report (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field). Further details of the four studies are presented in Appendix 10.9 of the assessment report; their quality was assessed using a simplified version of the Drummond and Jefferson checklist.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Modelling Approach&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Each study used a different modelling approach. One of the studies used a simple decision-tree structure and modelled cost and outcomes over 2 years. The second study used a patient-simulation model exploring two time horizons: 10 years and lifetime. The third study used a Markov model structure with a lifetime time horizon and a 6-month cycle length. The fourth study used a patient-level simulation model. The time horizon of the model appears to be lifetime although this was not explicitly stated in the paper. The model runs for continuous time with no fixed cycle length.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;A direct comparison of incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) between studies is not possible because of different approaches to modelling, in particular time-horizon, country of origin and perspective chosen &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;All studies used a decision-analytic model. Published models vary in some important aspects: the type of model used, the sequence of drugs, comparator therapies, and time-horizon &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Incremental analyses, to which appropriate sensitivity analyses had been applied, were reported without exception &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;All but one study carried out a cost-utility analysis and reported results in cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). One study carried out a cost-effectiveness analysis and reported results in cost per additional case of 'low disease-activity state' gained (disease activity score [DAS]28 &amp;lt;2.6) and cost per additional remission gained (DAS28 &amp;le;3.2) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;There was disparity in the selection of perspectives chosen for the analyses. One study reported costs that include both those from a healthcare perspective as well as indirect costs and costs of informal care; inclusion of these costs improves the cost-effectiveness of the drug. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critique of Manufacturers' Submissions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A submission was received from each company with each submission containing an economic analysis. However, only four manufacturers included a model. Table 71 of the assessment report and sections 2, 3, and 4 of the addendum to the assessment report provide a brief summary of the five economic analyses provided.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Independent Economic Assessment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Assessment Group's own independent analysis was carried out using the Birmingham Rheumatoid Arthritis Model (BRAM), which has been further updated to allow for a non-linear relationship between Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) and utility. Additional coding has been added to the model to facilitate the use of probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA). This means putting a distribution around all parameters in the model.

Consultee organisations include national groups representing patients and carers, the bodies representing health professionals, and the manufacturers of the technology under review. Consultees are invited to submit evidence during the appraisal and to comment on the appraisal documents.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Commentator organisations include manufacturers of the products with which the technology is being compared, the National Health Service (NHS) Quality Improvement Scotland and research groups working in the area. They can comment on the evidence and other documents but are not asked to submit evidence themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;NICE then commissions an independent academic centre to review published evidence on the technology and prepare an 'assessment report'. Consultees and commentators are invited to comment on the report. The assessment report and the comments on it are then drawn together in a document called the evaluation report.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An independent Appraisal Committee then considers the evaluation report. It holds a meeting where it hears direct, spoken evidence from nominated clinical experts, patients and carers. The Committee uses all the evidence to make its first recommendations, in a document called the 'appraisal consultation document' (ACD). NICE sends all the consultees and commentators a copy of this document and posts it on the NICE website. Further comments are invited from everyone taking part.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the Committee meets again it considers any comments submitted on the ACD; then it prepares its final recommendations in a document called the 'final appraisal determination' (FAD). This is submitted to NICE for approval.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Consultees have a chance to appeal against the final recommendations in the FAD. If there are no appeals, the final recommendations become the basis of the guidance that NICE issues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who Is on the Appraisal Committee?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;NICE technology appraisal recommendations are prepared by an independent committee. This includes health professionals working in the NHS and people who are familiar with the issues affecting patients and carers. Although the Appraisal Committee seeks the views of organisations representing health professionals, patients, carers, manufacturers and government, its advice is independent of any vested interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="146" OrdBy="450" ID="415" Name="Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not applicable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="148" OrdBy="460" ID="417" Name="Cost Analysis" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manufacturers' Submissions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All five manufacturers provided economic analyses to support their submissions. One analysis (etanercept, Pfizer) was provided only as a narrative summary and not as a fully executable model.

The model simulated people with rheumatoid arthritis based on the baseline characteristics of people in the British Society for Rheumatology Biologics Register. The model sampled people individually and compared each of the technologies (followed by a sequence of conventional DMARDs) with one another or with conventional DMARDs alone. It allowed for two stages of stopping treatment early. The first stage represented the possibility of stopping treatment after 6 weeks (assumed to be because of toxicity) and the second stage represented stopping treatment at between 6 and 24 weeks (assumed to be because of either toxicity or lack of efficacy). The model did not allow for stopping rituximab early because it was necessary to model the full costs of each cycle of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Refer to section 4 for of the original guideline document for further details.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary of Appraisal Committee's Key Conclusions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Rituximab was considered to be a cost-effective option, based on data from most of the models available for this appraisal. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Based on the evidence available, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab and abatacept compared with rituximab were either very high, or these drugs were dominated by rituximab (that is, rituximab was both more effective and less costly). &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;For people who are unable to take rituximab or methotrexate, the appropriate comparator was conventional DMARDs.

Treatment with rituximab should be given no more frequently than every 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Treatment with rituximab in combination with methotrexate should be continued only if there is an adequate response following initiation of therapy and if an adequate response is maintained following retreatment with a dosing interval of at least 6 months.
