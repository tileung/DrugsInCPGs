field).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After discussion with the technical expert panel (TEP), the ECP staff generated a list of article inclusion and exclusion criteria (see Table 2 in the Evidence Report; see also the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) for the Key Questions. Because of the large number of factors and interventions to review, the ECP staff searched initially for good quality systematic reviews. They included primary literature to update eligible reviews or when good quality reviews were unavailable. They limited the primary literature to comparative studies published in English that enrolled adults age 50 years or older at the time of final cognitive assessment, drawn from general populations in economically developed countries. General populations were defined as those drawn primarily from noninstitutionalized community settings or general medical populations. With three exceptions, observational studies were limited to longitudinal designs where the risk factor or intervention was measured prior to the outcome. Exceptions were made for traumatic brain injury and toxic/environmental exposures because of the difficulties studying these factors longitudinally, and for sleep apnea, because of the absence of cohort studies. Because Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a relatively uncommon event, a sample size greater than 300 was required to focus on studies with higher statistical power. For similar reasons, at least 1 year was required between exposure and outcomes assessment for studies of cognitive decline, and at least 2 years for studies of AD.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Literature Search Strategies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Based on the above-described inclusion/exclusion criteria, a list of Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) search terms was generated, supplemented by keyword searches, to search MEDLINE&amp;reg;. Search terms and strategies were developed in consultation with a medical librarian. The exact search strategies used are given in Appendix A at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ahrq.gov/downloads/pub/evidence/pdf/alzheimers/alzcog.pdf&quot; title=&quot;AHRQ Web site&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.ahrq.gov/downloads/pub/evidence/pdf/alzheimers/alzcog.pdf&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to MEDLINE&amp;reg;, the EPC staff searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews to identify relevant systematic reviews. For topics with a recent good quality systematic review, the search was updated by identifying relevant primary literature published from 1 year prior to the search date through October 27, 2009. The 1-year overlap is necessary because of delays between publication in journals and availability for searching in MEDLINE&amp;reg;. Relevant older literature missed or excluded in prior reviews that was relevant and met eligibility criteria was included.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the EPC staff did not identify a relevant good quality review, they searched the primary literature to include studies from 1984 through October 27, 2009. Electronic searching was supplemented by examining the bibliographies of reviews and primary studies. Because of the large volume of literature and availability of specialized registries for genetic studies, they developed a separate search strategy for this literature. The HUGE and ALZGene databases were examined to identify relevant systematic reviews for genes identified as being of special interest in consultation with the TEP.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Using the pre-specified inclusion/exclusion criteria, titles/abstracts were examined independently by two reviewers for potential relevance to the key questions. Articles included by either reviewer underwent full-text screening. At the full-text screening stage, two independent reviewers read each article to determine if it met eligibility criteria. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. At the full-text review stage, simple agreement was 84 percent, and median chance corrected agreement was kappa = 0.63 (range 0.40 to 1.0). Articles meeting the eligibility criteria were included for data abstraction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="136" OrdBy="415" ID="408" Name="Number of Source Documents" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Twenty-five systematic reviews &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;250 original research studies &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="115" OrdBy="420" ID="409" Name="Methods Used to Assess the Quality and Strength of the Evidence" Type="picklist-choice"><FieldValue Value="Weighting According to a Rating Scheme (Scheme Not Given)" /></Field><Field FieldID="149" OrdBy="425" ID="410" Name="Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not stated&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="116" OrdBy="430" ID="411" Name="Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence" Type="picklist-many"><FieldValue Value="Meta-Analysis" /><FieldValue Value="Review of Published Meta-Analyses" /><FieldValue Value="Systematic Review with Evidence Tables" /></Field><Field FieldID="150" OrdBy="435" ID="412" Name="Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)&lt;/strong&gt;: A systematic review of the literature was prepared by the Duke Evidence-based Practice Center (EPC) for the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) for use by the National Institutes of Health (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Abstraction and Data Management&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Data from published reports were abstracted into evidence tables by one reviewer and overread by a second reviewer. Data elements abstracted included descriptors to assess applicability, quality elements, intervention/exposure details, and outcomes. Disagreements were resolved by consensus or by obtaining a third reviewer's opinion when consensus could not be reached. The final evidence tables are intended to provide sufficient information so that readers can understand the study and determine its quality. Evidence tables for all included studies are presented in Appendix B of the Evidence Report (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field). Because some studies address more than one exposure or question, the evidence tables are organized alphabetically by author.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assessment of Methodological Quality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Separate criteria were developed for assessing the methodological quality of included systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and observational studies. These criteria are given in Appendices C, D, and E of the Evidence Report, respectively (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Principles from the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) working group (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org&quot; title=&quot;GRADE Working Group Web site&quot;&gt;www.gradeworkinggroup.org&lt;/a&gt;) were used to summarize the level of evidence for each factor as low, moderate, or high. The GRADE approach was developed to evaluate the overall level of evidence for interventions, but it has been extended to factors (e.g., medical illness) that would not be considered as interventions. The approach considers the body of evidence for each outcome, assigning an initial rating of low quality to observational studies and high quality to RCTs. These initial ratings may be modified by the following factors: detailed study design, consistency, strength of association, dose-response effect, directness, precision, and if all plausible confounding would reduce a demonstrated effect. The resulting judgments about the level of evidence are presented separately in summary tables for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cognitive decline in Chapter 5 of the Evidence Report (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field). Judgments about the strength of evidence were made by at least two investigators; final ratings were reached by consensus.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Synthesis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When good quality systematic reviews were identified, the EPC staff summarized the findings in narrative form in Chapter 3 of the Evidence Report (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field). Any new studies identified since the systematic review was published are summarized descriptively in a table that includes the study sample, exposure classification, duration of follow-up, adjustment for confounding, and primary outcomes. The EPC staff evaluated whether the new evidence was likely to change estimates from the prior review by considering the precision and stability of estimates from the original review, the number and size of the new studies relative to studies in the original review, the quality of the new studies, and the consistency in estimates and conclusions between the new evidence and the original review. After considering these issues, prior meta-analyses were updated when substantial new evidence was available and a new summary estimate was likely to lead to different conclusions. Primary meta-analysis was performed when studies were conceptually homogeneous and the needed data were available for the summary estimate. Since meta-analysis of observational studies may give spurious precision, meta-analysis was applied to observational data only when studies were high quality and conceptually homogeneous (similar subjects, exposure, outcomes).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Refer to Chapter 2 of the Evidence Report (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) for more information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="112" OrdBy="440" ID="413" Name="Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations" Type="picklist-choice"><FieldValue Value="Expert Consensus (Consensus Development Conference)" /></Field><Field FieldID="145" OrdBy="445" ID="414" Name="Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;National Institutes of Health (NIH) consensus and state-of-the-science statements are prepared by independent panels of health professionals and public representatives on the basis of 1) the results of a systematic literature review prepared under contract with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ); 2) presentations by investigators working in areas relevant to the conference questions during a 2-day public session; 3) questions and statements from conference attendees during open discussion periods that are part of the public session; and 4) closed deliberations by the panel during the remainder of the second day and morning of the third.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The National Institute on Aging and the Office of Medical Applications of Research of the National Institutes of Health convened a State-of-the-Science Conference on April 26&amp;ndash;28, 2010, to assess the available scientific evidence related to the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;What factors are associated with the reduction of risk of Alzheimer's disease? &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;What factors are associated with the reduction of risk of cognitive decline in older adults? &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;What are the therapeutic and adverse effects of interventions to delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease?

Extensive research over the past 20 years has provided important insights on the nature of Alzheimer's disease and cognitive decline and the magnitude of the problem. Nevertheless, there remain important and formidable challenges in conducting research on these diseases, particularly in the area of prevention. Currently, firm conclusions cannot be drawn about the association of any modifiable risk factor with cognitive decline or Alzheimer's disease. Highly reliable consensus-based diagnostic criteria for cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease are lacking, and available criteria have not been uniformly applied. Evidence is insufficient to support the use of pharmaceutical agents or dietary supplements to prevent cognitive decline or Alzheimer's disease. The guideline developers recognize that a large amount of promising research is under way; these efforts need to be increased and added to by new understandings and innovations (as noted in the recommendations for future research).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, ongoing studies including (but not limited to) studies on antihypertensive medications, omega-3 fatty acids, physical activity, and cognitive engagement may provide new insights into the prevention or delay of cognitive decline or Alzheimer's disease. This important research needs to be supplemented by further studies. Large-scale population-based studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are critically needed to investigate strategies to maintain cognitive function in individuals at risk for decline, to identify factors that may delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease among persons at risk, and to identify factors that may slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease among persons in whom the condition is already diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="138" OrdBy="515" ID="423" Name="Clinical Algorithm(s)" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;None provided&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field></Section><Section SecID="424" OrdBy="600" Name="Evidence Supporting the Recommendations"><Field FieldID="139" OrdBy="610" ID="426" Name="Type of Evidence Supporting the Recommendations" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The type of supporting evidence is not specifically stated for each recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field></Section><Section SecID="427" OrdBy="700" Name="Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations"><Field FieldID="152" OrdBy="705" ID="428" Name="Potential Benefits" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Better understanding of currently available data on the prevention of Alzheimer's disease and cognitive decline&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="153" OrdBy="710" ID="429" Name="Potential Harms" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not stated&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field></Section><Section SecID="432" OrdBy="900" Name="Qualifying Statements"><Field FieldID="137" OrdBy="905" ID="433" Name="Qualifying Statements" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The statement reflects the panel's assessment of medical knowledge available at the time the statement was written.
