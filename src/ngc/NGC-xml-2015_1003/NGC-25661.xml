Gray literature searches (e.g., company and genetic testing web sites) were conducted to collect information on laboratories offering testing for these markers and the methodologies used. When these sources were not sufficient, the companies offering heart health genomic panels were contacted for information, first by an e-mail questionnaire and then by phone (for those not responding).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Validity Literature Search&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A comprehensive review of all gene/CVD associations was determined by the EGAPP Working Group (EWG) to be outside the scope of the review, which was limited to (1) addressing two major CVD outcomes groupings (i.e., coronary heart disease [CHD] and stroke), (2) examining only those genes/polymorphisms included in cardiogenomic panels available in April 2008, and (3) using existing high-quality meta-analyses whenever possible. Literature searches were conducted using HuGE Navigator v1.3 after crosschecking a subset of genes by a PubMed search. Specific search strategies for each gene are contained in &lt;a href=&quot;http://links.lww.com/GIM/A124&quot; title=&quot;Supplemental digital content&quot;&gt;Appendix, Supplemental Digital Content 1&lt;/a&gt;. Reference lists of retrieved publications were examined for relevant studies. Searches were performed between June 2008 and January 2009. One investigator had primary responsibility for each gene, and results were reviewed by another. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Criteria for Inclusion of Studies for Clinical Validity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To be included, a publication needed to be in English and include information about whites. The outcome needed to be a primary CVD event, heart disease, or stroke. Sufficient data needed to be present to express the effect size as an odds ratio with confidence intervals. Existing meta-analyses were used preferentially, but structured summaries of original publications were created when no suitable meta-analyses were found.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Utility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A systematic review of the literature on the clinical utility of the 29 markers was not undertaken. Rather, PubMed searches focused on identifying potential benefits and harms associated with addition of CVD-associated alleles/SNPs to existing risk assessment algorithms based on conventional risk factors and on the potential for genetic information to motivate behavioral change. Articles from the clinical validity review were also reviewed for information related to clinical utility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="136" OrdBy="415" ID="408" Name="Number of Source Documents" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not stated&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="115" OrdBy="420" ID="409" Name="Methods Used to Assess the Quality and Strength of the Evidence" Type="picklist-choice"><FieldValue Value="Weighting According to a Rating Scheme (Scheme Not Given)" /></Field><Field FieldID="149" OrdBy="425" ID="410" Name="Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not stated&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="116" OrdBy="430" ID="411" Name="Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence" Type="picklist-many"><FieldValue Value="Meta-Analysis" /><FieldValue Value="Review of Published Meta-Analyses" /><FieldValue Value="Systematic Review with Evidence Tables" /></Field><Field FieldID="150" OrdBy="435" ID="412" Name="Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)&lt;/strong&gt;: Consultants from Women &amp;amp; Infants Hospital, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, with experience in evidence review of genetic tests were contracted by the Office of Public Health Genomics at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to perform the targeted review with the assistance of four Evaluation of Genomic Applications in Practice and Prevention (EGAPP) staff members and other outside consultants. Guidance was provided by a Technical Expert Panel. (See the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An analytic framework and key questions (see the &quot;Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence&quot; field and Figure 1 in the original guideline document) were developed and refined by the EGAPP Working Group (EWG) and Technical Expert Panel members, with support from EGAPP staff. The review focuses on clinical validity but addresses the limited information available on analytic validity and considers proposed measures of clinical utility in clinical practice and in direct-to-consumer settings. Standard methods used include systematic search criteria for identification of published and gray literature; application of inclusion/exclusion criteria; abstraction of data; meta-analysis; assessment of the quality of individual studies; and overall strength of evidence. Limiting key questions and truncating search strategies (e.g., targeted gray literature searches) are two common methods in targeted reviews. In reviewing the available evidence, questions from the ACCE (Analytic validity, Clinical validity, Clinical utility and Ethical, Legal and Social Implication) review framework were often used to identify and organize the specific information needed to address the key questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Analyses for Clinical Validity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Summary odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were derived using a random-effects model (Comprehensive Meta-analysis, Version 2, Englewood, NJ), from the original source (published meta-analysis), from a reanalysis of the reported data, or from a new literature summary. The preferred method for determining the summary ORs was to compare wild-type individuals (no at-risk alleles) with heterozygotes (one at-risk allele) and then separately compare wild type with homozygotes (two at-risk alleles). Other models were also used. For example, when the frequency of the at-risk allele was very low, heterozygotes and homozygotes were combined and compared against the wild type. Some existing meta-analyses included formal assessment of heterogeneity, usually a chi-squared-based Q statistic. This was converted to the &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; statistic for ease of interpretation and comparison between studies. Some also included a formal examination of publication bias or stratified the summary OR by sample size. If sufficient data were available, potential publication bias was looked for.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluating Credibility of the Cumulative Evidence for a Gene-Disease Association&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In 2007, a consensus group recommended evaluation guidelines to assess the cumulative evidence provided by genetic association studies. These &quot;Venice&quot; criteria focus on amount of evidence, replication of evidence, and protection from bias. See the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence&quot; field.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is no generally accepted process to revise the effect size estimate, if credibility is rated as moderate or low due to potential biases (e.g., publication bias). To provide an indication of the extent of potential change in effect size, we performed a cumulative effects analysis for combinations having a minimum of six studies (three of which included 500 or more participants). The analysis adds one study at a time, from smallest to largest confidence interval, to create multiple estimates for the summary OR. If the range of these cumulative ORs is wide, potential for bias exists. The range was defined as the difference between the final cumulative OR and the first stable estimate (the third of three consecutive estimates all within 10% of each other). Usually, but not always, this occurred within the first three large studies. The ranges &amp;lt;0.1, 0.1&amp;ndash;0.19, and &amp;ge;0.2 were considered small, medium, and large ranges, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Combining CVD Genetic Markers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a way to set a reasonable upper limit on the effect size of several genetic markers, a multiplicative model was chosen that assumes each marker is an independent predictor of CVD risk. Before multiplication, the ORs were adjusted, so that there was no overall impact on CVD risk. For example, if an at-risk genotype was present in 10% of the population and was associated with a summary OR of 1.1, an OR of 1.09 would be used for the 10% at risk and 0.99 for the remaining 90%. A Monte Carlo simulation generated 100,000 individuals with, and 100,000 without, heart disease (or stroke) with their associated cumulative ORs. When multiple variants were available for a given gene, the one with the strongest evidence was used. If two variants had similar credibility, the one with the largest impact (effect size time &amp;times; at risk proportion) was used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="112" OrdBy="440" ID="413" Name="Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations" Type="picklist-choice"><FieldValue Value="Expert Consensus" /></Field><Field FieldID="145" OrdBy="445" ID="414" Name="Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)&lt;/strong&gt;: Consultants from Women &amp;amp; Infants Hospital, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, with experience in evidence review of genetic tests were contracted by the Office of Public Health Genomics at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to perform the targeted review with the assistance of four Evaluation of Genomic Applications in Practice and Prevention (EGAPP) staff members and other outside consultants.

(See the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;EGAPP is a project developed by the Office of Public Health Genomics at the CDC to support a rigorous, evidence-based process for evaluating genetic tests and other genomic applications that are in transition from research to clinical and public health practice in the United States. The EGAPP Working Group (EWG) commissioned evidence review was contracted by the Office of Public Health Genomics and performed by a collaboration of external consultants and four EGAPP staff members. A Technical Expert Panel that included four EWG members and two additional consultants provided expert guidance during the course of the review. Two main groups of outcomes were defined based on the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (I00&amp;ndash;I99). The first group, coronary heart disease (CHD), includes coronary artery disease, ischemic heart disease, and myocardial infarction. The second group, stroke, includes intracerebral and subarachnoid hemorrhage, ischemic stroke, and other diseases (e.g., cerebral infarction and occlusion/stenosis of cerebral arteries). In addition to the larger review, a peer-reviewed article on 9p21 has been published with detailed information available (see &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot;). The final EWG recommendation statement was formulated based on magnitude of effect, certainty of evidence, and consideration of contextual factors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An analytic framework and key questions were developed and refined by the EWG and Technical Expert Panel members, with support from EGAPP staff. The review focuses on clinical validity but addresses the limited information available on analytic validity and considers proposed measures of clinical utility in clinical practice and in direct-to-consumer settings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In reviewing the available evidence, questions from the ACCE (Analytic validity, Clinical validity, Clinical utility and Ethical, legal and social implication) review framework were often used to identify and organize the specific information needed to address the key questions.

The EWG found that the magnitude of net health benefit from use of any of these tests alone or in combination is negligible. The EWG discourages clinical use unless further evidence supports improved clinical outcomes. Based on the available evidence, the overall certainty of net health benefit is deemed &quot;Low.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rationale&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It has been suggested that an improvement in CVD risk classification (adjusting intermediate risk of CVD into high- or low-risk categories) might lead to management changes (e.g., earlier initiation or higher rates of medical interventions, or targeted recommendations for behavioral change) that improve CVD outcomes. In the absence of direct evidence to support this possibility, this review sought indirect evidence aimed at documenting the extent to which genomic profiling alters CVD risk estimation, alone and in combination with traditional risk factors, and the extent to which risk reclassification improves health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analytic Validity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Assay-related evidence on available genomic profiling tests was deemed inadequate. However, based on existing technologies that have been or may be used and on data from two of the companies performing such testing, the analytic sensitivity and specificity of tests for individual gene variants might be at least satisfactory.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Validity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Twenty-nine gene candidates were evaluated, with 58 different gene variant/disease associations (see Table 1 in the original guideline document). Evidence on clinical validity was rated inadequate for 34 of these associations (59%) and adequate for 23 (40%). Inadequate grades were based on limited evidence, poor replication, existence of possible biases, or combinations of these factors. For heart disease (25 combined associations) and stroke (13 combined associations), profiling provided areas under the receiver operator characteristics curve of 66% and 57%, respectively. Only the association of 9p21 variants with heart disease had convincing evidence of a per-allele odds ratio of between 1.2 and 1.3; this was the highest effect size for any variant/disease combination with at least adequate evidence. Although the 9p21 association seems to be independent of traditional risk factors, there is adequate evidence that the improvement in risk prediction is, at best, small.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Utility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Clinical utility was not formally evaluated in any of the studies reported to date, including for 9p21. As a result, no evidence was available on the balance of benefits and harms. Also, there was no direct evidence available to assess the health benefits and harms of adding these markers to traditional risk factors (e.g., Framingham Risk Score). However, the estimated additional benefit from adding genomic markers to traditional risk factors was found to be negligible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contextual Issues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Prevention of CVD is a public health priority. Improvements in outcomes associated with genomic profiling could have important impacts. Traditional risk factors such as those used in the Framingham Risk Scores have an advantage in clinical screening and risk assessment strategies because they measure the actual targets for therapy (e.g., lipid levels and blood pressure). To add value, genomic testing should lead to better outcomes than those achievable by assessment and treatment of traditional risk factors alone. Some issues important for clinical utility remain unknown, such as the biological mechanism underlying the most convincing marker's (9p21) association with CVD; the level of risk that changes intervention; whether long-term disease outcomes will improve; how individuals ordering direct to consumer tests will understand/respond to test results and interact with the health care system; and whether direct to consumer testing will motivate behavior change or amplify potential harms.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Clinical Considerations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definitions Used by Evaluation of Genomic Applications in Practice and Prevention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Analytic validity refers to a test's ability to accurately and reliably measure the genotype or analyte of interest. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Clinical validity defines the ability of the test to accurately and reliably identify or predict the intermediate or final outcomes of interest. This is usually reported as clinical sensitivity and specificity. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Clinical utility defines the balance of benefits and harms associated with using the test in practice, including improvement in measurable clinical outcomes and added value in clinical management and decision making compared with not using the test. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patient Population Under Consideration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These recommendations apply to the general population of adults without known preexisting cardiovascular disease (CVD), regardless of family history.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Considerations for Practice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These tests have become available through primary care clinician offices and through direct to consumer marketing. Patients may ask about such tests or bring results of completed tests to their physicians for advice or consultation. Physicians should routinely consider well-established recommendations for cardiac risk assessment in the primary care setting (e.g., smoking, blood pressure, and lipid screening). In addition, all patients should be consistently counseled regarding appropriate physical activity and nutrition behaviors to reduce cardiac risk. Based on the available evidence, it is unclear how the results of genomic profiling should modify patient care to improve outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Contextual Issues Important to the Recommendation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;CVD is an important public health problem and improvements in outcomes associated with genomic testing could have important impacts. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The traditional modifiable CVD risk factors, such as those used in the Framingham Risk Scores, have an advantage in clinical screening and risk assessment strategies because they measure the actual targets for therapy (e.g., lipid levels and blood pressure). &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;It is important to recognize that there may be differences in the utility of genomic markers in predicting coronary risk compared with stroke risk. This is true for the traditional risk factors&amp;nbsp;used in Framingham, which has better utility for coronary artery disease than for stroke. Ultimately, it would be preferable to have research that evaluates and reports the utility for each condition separately. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;To be useful, genomic testing should provide demonstrable improvement on the predictive value of traditional risk factors. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The genetic mechanism of some candidate gene variants (e.g., 9p21) is unknown. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Definitions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendations Based on Certainty of Evidence, Magnitude of Net Benefit, and Contextual Issues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;3&quot; summary=&quot;Table: Recommendations Based on Certainty of Evidence, Magnitude of Net Benefit, and Contextual Issues&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;tbody&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;tr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;th valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;High or Moderate&lt;/th&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommend for&lt;/strong&gt;:&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;                &lt;li&gt;If the magnitude of net benefit is Substantial, Moderate, or Small, unless additional considerations warrant caution. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;                &lt;li&gt;Consider the importance of each relevant contextual factor and its magnitude or finding. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;strong&gt;Recommend against&lt;/strong&gt;:&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;                &lt;li&gt;If the magnitude of net benefit is Zero or there are net harms. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;                &lt;li&gt;Consider the importance of each relevant contextual factor and its magnitude or finding. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;/td&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;/tr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;tr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;th valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Low&lt;/th&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insufficient evidence&lt;/strong&gt;:&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;                &lt;li&gt;If the evidence for clinical utility or clinical validity is insufficient in quantity or quality to support conclusions or make a recommendation. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;                &lt;li&gt;Consider the importance of each contextual factor and its magnitude or finding. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;                &lt;li&gt;Determine whether the recommendation should be Insufficient (neutral), Insufficient (encouraging), or Insufficient (discouraging). &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;                &lt;li&gt;Provide information on key information gaps to drive a research agenda. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;/td&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;/tr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/tbody&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/table&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p class=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;Teutsch SM, Bradley LA, Palomaki GE, Haddow JE, Piper M, Calonge N, Dotson WD, Douglas MP, Berg AO; EGAPP Working Group.

Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides support to the EGAPP Working Group, including staff support in the preparation of this document, recommendations made by the EGAPP Working Group should not be construed as official positions of the CDC or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The EGAPP Working Group found the research literature insufficient, with important gaps in knowledge. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Most analyses have been restricted to whites, usually of European descent; results in other race/ethnic groups might differ in effect size, prevalence of at-risk genotypes, variant of interest, or some combination of these. Some of the gene-disease associations under review involve a small effect size for relatively uncommon genotypes. The current genome-wide association (GWA) studies may be underpowered or limited in single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) coverage of the genome to reliably confirm or reject real associations in the genes reviewed. The finding of weak associations between gene variants and cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes does not exclude possible roles for these variants in the pathway of lipid metabolism or in other pathways associated with CVD. Many studies have confirmed both gene/lipid associations and that the variants identified are functional. However, the function of the marker with the highest credibility, 9p21, is not well described. Understanding its role in disease etiology might result in an improved understanding of the process, leading to improved treatments or prevention activities. Publication bias seems to be an important problem in the literature regarding genomic tests for CVD. Finally, the genes included in this study were, on average, described more than five years ago, with the newest one (9p21) first reported in 2007. Since that time, one GWA study has reported new markers that may also have strong credibility, once confirmatory studies have been reported. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;" /></Field></Section><Section SecID="434" OrdBy="1000" Name="Implementation of the Guideline"><Field FieldID="131" OrdBy="1010" ID="436" Name="Description of Implementation Strategy" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;An implementation strategy was not provided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field></Section><Section SecID="439" OrdBy="1100" Name="Institute of Medicine (IOM) National Healthcare Quality Report Categories"><Field FieldID="50" OrdBy="1105" ID="440" Name="IOM Care Need" Type="picklist-many"><FieldValue Value="Staying Healthy" /></Field><Field FieldID="51" OrdBy="1110" ID="441" Name="IOM Domain" Type="picklist-many"><FieldValue Value="Effectiveness" /><FieldValue Value="Patient-centeredness" /></Field></Section><Section SecID="442" OrdBy="1200" Name="Identifying Information and Availability"><Field FieldID="97" OrdBy="1201" ID="392" Name="Bibliographic Source(s)" Type="citation"><FieldValue Value="&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Evaluation of Genomic Applications in Practice and Prevention (EGAPP) Working Group.
