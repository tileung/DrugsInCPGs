The ERG report for this technology appraisal was prepared by the School of Health and Related Research (ScHARR), the University of Sheffield (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Clinical Effectiveness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critique of the Methods Used by the Manufacturer to Systematically Review Clinical Effectiveness Evidence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The review aimed to update the Cochrane review on thrombolysis but restricting it to search for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of alteplase.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Searches&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An existing search strategy from the Cochrane review &quot;Thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke&quot; was adapted by excluding all thrombolytic drug terms other than those relating to alteplase. The search was limited to RCTs published from 2008 onwards as the Cochrane review searches were conducted in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The searches were conducted on the following databases via the OVID platform:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Medline-R In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Medline&amp;ndash;R 1946-Present with Daily Update &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Embase &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;All Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) reviews (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews [DSR], American College of Physicians [ACP] Journal Club, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness [DARE], Cochrane Controlled Trials Register [CCTR], Cochrane Methodology Register [CMR], Health Technology Assessment [HTA], National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database [NHSEED]) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;EconLit &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Searches were conducted on 14th February 2012. The specific date span for each database is not given. Additional searches were carried out on internal company databases; however, this did not identify any extra studies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The search strategy was appropriate and basing it on an existing published review ensured the population and intervention terms were comprehensive. However, the terms used to identify RCTs are different to those used in the Cochrane Review. It is not stated if a published search filter was used. Some of the terms used to find RCTs retrieved 0 results and therefore it is possible that alternative terms would have been more appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By amending the search terms, an additional 9 references are found in the Medline search. However, 7 of these were found in the Embase search so were not missed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are no additional comments about the Embase search strategy, as this used the same RCT terms as the original Cochrane Review.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The specific search strategies for EBM reviews and EconLit are not included so it is not possible to comment on these. The assumption is that the Medline or Embase strategies were used.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria Used in the Study Selection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The study selection process was based on the Cochrane review of thrombolysis, but was adapted to restrict to use of alteplase within UK marketing authorisation. This was appropriate as it reflected the NICE scope. The population was restricted to adults aged 18 to 80 with acute ischaemic stroke (AIS), without intracranial bleeding, confirmed by brain imaging. The intervention was alteplase in addition to standard medical and supportive management. The intervention was restricted to 0.9mg/kg alteplase (to a maximum of 90mg, 10% as initial intravenous bolus, 90% as infusion over the subsequent 60 minutes) with treatment administration within the 0 to 4.5 hour time period. These inclusion criteria were appropriate as they conform with the licence for alteplase and the NICE scope.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The manufacturer's submission (MS) states that the main comparator was placebo or standard medical and supportive management without thrombolysis. It was appropriate that there was no active comparator, as alteplase is currently the only thrombolytic agent licensed in the UK for use in AIS. The comparator used in study selection in the MS was placebo. This was more restrictive than stipulated in the NICE scope which stated &quot;standard medical and supportive management that does not include alteplase&quot;. Placebo controlled trials may be considered less prone to bias than trials in which the comparator is no additional treatment, as the administration of placebo would allow blinding of patients and clinicians. In the case of alteplase, it is difficult to ensure that clinician blinding would be effective. The appearance of the drug would differ from placebo, as alteplase froths when shaken in solution with water or normal saline, and thus normal saline does not form an identical placebo. Also, the biological effect of thrombolytic therapy may be apparent (for example, prolonged bleeding at venepuncture sites, easy bruising, gingival or conjunctival haemorrhages). In practice, the inclusion of non-placebo comparator at study selection would only allow the possibility of one additional trial, IST-3, and the results of this were not available at the time of MS.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The MS states that the primary outcome measures were death or dependency and mortality, however the study selection exclusion criteria did not exclude on the basis of outcomes, suggesting that other outcomes specified in the NICE scope were considered. Study design was restricted to RCTs. Given the known availability of RCTs on the topic, including RCTs and not lower quality studies was appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Refer to Section 4.1 of the ERG Report (see &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) for more information.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost Effectiveness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ERG Comment on Manufacturer's Review of Cost-effectiveness Evidence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The MS does not explicitly state the objectives of the cost-effectiveness review. The cost-effectiveness search was conducted in December 2011 on the following databases:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;EMBASE via Ovid (1988-present) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;MEDLINE via Ovid (1948-present) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;NHS EED via Metaxis (1990-present) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;MEDLINE In-Process via Ovid (1948-present) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;EconLit via Ovid (1961-present) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The search strategy was appropriate, and standard cost-effectiveness terms were used to identify economic evaluations, although it is not stated whether this was using a published methodological search filter or not. There is a slight error in the presentation of the Embase search strategy, step 28 is not included in the combination of terms; however, this would not have affected the search results. In addition, the MEDLINE In-Process strategy is unclear as it appears to also include MEDLINE (1948-present) as MeSH headings are not available in the MEDLINE In-Process database. This is a minor point which again would not affect the results of the search.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The MS does not explicitly state the inclusion criteria. However, MS provides the following table which can be considered as de facto inclusion criteria.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Table: Inclusion Criteria for Cost-effectiveness Review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; summary=&quot;Table: Inclusion Criteria for Cost-effectiveness Review&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;tbody&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;tr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;th valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Study Design&lt;/th&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Cost-effectiveness analysis, cost-utility analysis, cost-benefit analysis, cost-consequence analysis&lt;/td&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;/tr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;tr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;th valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Setting&lt;/th&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Any location&lt;/td&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;/tr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;tr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;th valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Population&lt;/th&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Acute stroke patients&lt;/td&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;/tr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;tr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;th valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Intervention&lt;/th&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Actilyse&lt;sup&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/sup&gt;, Alteplase rt-PA, rtPA&lt;/td&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;/tr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;tr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;th valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Comparator(s)&lt;/th&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Any&lt;/td&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;/tr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;tr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;th valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Outcome(s)&lt;/th&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and/or cost per unit of effect&lt;/td&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;/tr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;tr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;th valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Time Period&lt;/th&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;No restriction&lt;/td&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;/tr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/tbody&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/table&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The MS does not state the exclusion criteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="136" OrdBy="415" ID="408" Name="Number of Source Documents" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Effectiveness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ten randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and one observational study were included in the review.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost Effectiveness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Nine studies were included in the review &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The manufacturer submitted an economic model. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="115" OrdBy="420" ID="409" Name="Methods Used to Assess the Quality and Strength of the Evidence" Type="picklist-choice"><FieldValue Value="Expert Consensus" /></Field><Field FieldID="149" OrdBy="425" ID="410" Name="Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not applicable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="116" OrdBy="430" ID="411" Name="Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence" Type="picklist-many"><FieldValue Value="Meta-Analysis" /><FieldValue Value="Review of Published Meta-Analyses" /><FieldValue Value="Systematic Review with Evidence Tables" /></Field><Field FieldID="150" OrdBy="435" ID="412" Name="Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)&lt;/strong&gt;: The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) commissioned an independent academic centre to perform an assessment of the manufacturer's submission on the technology considered in this appraisal and prepare an Evidence Review Group (ERG) report. The ERG report for this technology appraisal was prepared by the School of Health and Related Research (ScHARR), the University of Sheffield (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Effectiveness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quality Assessment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Table 12 and Table 13 of the ERG report (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) provide quality assessment of included trials.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evidence Synthesis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The manufacturer's submission (MS) presents meta-analyses using the Mantel&amp;ndash;Haenszel method to calculate relative risks (RR). This was an appropriate method. The Cochrane handbook recommends presenting RR data as they are more easily interpretable than odds ratios, and the Mantel&amp;ndash;Haenszel method is reliable even when few trials are available for analysis. Meta-analyses are presented for both fixed and random effects, as recommended by Cochrane.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There were no additional trials identified to those included in the 2007 NICE Single Technology Appraisal TA122. The main evidence was provided by meta-analysis of the European-Australasian Acute Stroke Study (ECASS) II and National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) trials. Sensitivity analyses included the Alteplase Thrombolysis for Acute Noninterventional Therapy in Ischemic Stroke (ATLANTIS) A and ATLANTIS B trials. For the 3-4.5 hour treatment window, the main evidence was provided by the ECASS III trials. Sensitivity analyses included CIC data from the ATLANTIS A, ATLANTIS B and the ECASS II trials in meta-analyses. Table 15 of the ERG report shows RRs generated by meta-analyses. Study results of ECASS III are shown in the Table, alongside meta-analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the 0-3 hour treatment window, there was no statistically significant difference in all-cause mortality at 3 months in either the fixed or random effects meta-analysis. There was an increased risk of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (SICH), RR 4.90 (1.90-12.61) p=0.001 significant by fixed meta-analysis, but failing to reach significance by random effects meta-analysis. The results of the sensitivity analysis incorporating data from the ATLANTIS trial were similar although in this analysis the RR for SICH was significantly higher for both fixed and random effects meta-analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Death or dependency at three months follow-up significantly favoured alteplase, RR 0.81 (95%CI 0.72-0.92) p=0.002, by the meta-analysis of the two main trials which included 393 participants allocated to alteplase, and 389 to placebo. Similarly, by the sensitivity analysis including n=416 alteplase, and n=427 placebo participants, RR 0.82 (95%CI 0.72-0.93) p=0.002, death or dependency at three months follow-up significantly favoured alteplase.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the 3-4.5 hour treatment window, the main evidence used in the MS is the ECASS III RCT. This RCT included n=418 alteplase and n=403 placebo participants. In the ECASS III trial, death or dependency at three months follow-up did not show a statistically significant treatment effect RR (for alteplase with reference to placebo) 0.87 (95%CI 0.73-1.05) p=0.14. Sensitivity analysis using commercial in confidence (CIC) data from an additional three studies, alteplase n=694, placebo n=694, produced an RR which significantly favoured alteplase if analysed by fixed-effect&amp;nbsp;methods RR 0.87 (0.78-0.99) p=0.03, showing a similar trend that failed to reach significance if analysed by random-effect methods 0.87 (0.74-1.04) p=0.12. As can be seen, the RR values were similar, and this difference can be attributed to the more conservative estimates produced by random-effect analyses than by fixed-effect analyses. For the 3-4.5 hour treatment window, there was no statistically significant difference in all-cause mortality at 3 month, but there was a significantly increased risk of SICH, RR 4.82 (1.06-21.87) p=0.04.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Considering the 0-4.5 hour treatment window, analysis of the two main trials of 0-3 hours, n=393 alteplase and n=389 placebo, and the main trial of 3-4.5 hours, n=418 alteplase and n=403 placebo, random-effects meta-analysis showed an RR 0.83 (0.75-0.92) p=0.0006, significantly favouring alteplase. Again, there was no statistically significant increase in all-cause mortality at 3 months, but there was a significantly increased risk of SICH.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Refer to Section 4 of the ERG Report (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) for detailed discussion of methods used to analyze clinical effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost-Effectiveness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model Structure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The economic model is an extension of the economic model constructed and published as part of the Health Technology Assessment (HTA) of thrombolytic therapy by Sandercock et al. (Sandercock, P., Berge, E., Dennis, M., Forbes, J., Hand, P., Kwan, J. et al. A systematic review of the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and barriers to implementation of thrombolytic and neuroprotective therapy for acute ischaemic stroke in the &lt;em&gt;NHS. Health Technology Assessment [Winchester, England]&lt;/em&gt; 2002; 6[26], i-102). The model has been replicated using the same structure and inputs described in the text of the published appraisal, with parameters revised using up-to-date data on costs and effects where possible. The economic evaluation extends the Sandercock et al. analysis further by incorporating the efficacy evidence for the 3-4.5 hour treatment window sub-group as reported in ECASS III. Use of the relative risks for this treatment window enables the effectiveness estimate to reflect the extended product licence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The model is split into 3 phases:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Phase 1: Patients enter phase I with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) with confirmed eligibility for alteplase treatment. It is during this phase that the treatment effect of alteplase is applied. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Phase II. Patients enter phase II at 6 months. No treatment effect is applied here. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Phase III: Patients enter phase III at 12 months. During phase III a 12 month cycle length is applied for the rest of the lifetime model. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The model has a Markov structure, a diagram of the model, provided in the MS, is shown in Figure 1 of the ERG report (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Refer to Section 5 of the ERG report (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) for more information on cost-effectiveness analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="112" OrdBy="440" ID="413" Name="Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations" Type="picklist-choice"><FieldValue Value="Expert Consensus" /></Field><Field FieldID="145" OrdBy="445" ID="414" Name="Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Considerations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Technology appraisal recommendations are based on a review of clinical and economic evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technology Appraisal Process&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) invites 'consultee' and 'commentator' organisations to take part in the appraisal process. Consultee organisations include national groups representing patients and carers, the bodies representing health professionals, and the manufacturers of the technology under review. Consultees are invited to submit evidence during the appraisal and to comment on the appraisal documents.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Commentator organisations include manufacturers of the products with which the technology is being compared, the National Health Service (NHS) Quality Improvement Scotland and research groups working in the area. They can comment on the evidence and other documents but are not asked to submit evidence themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;NICE then commissions an independent academic centre to review published evidence on the technology and prepare an 'assessment report'. Consultees and commentators are invited to comment on the report. The assessment report and the comments on it are then drawn together in a document called the evaluation report.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An independent Appraisal Committee then considers the evaluation report. It holds a meeting where it hears direct, spoken evidence from nominated clinical experts, patients and carers. The Committee uses all the evidence to make its first recommendations, in a document called the 'appraisal consultation document' (ACD). NICE sends all the consultees and commentators a copy of this document and posts it on the NICE website. Further comments are invited from everyone taking part.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the Committee meets again it considers any comments submitted on the ACD; then it prepares its final recommendations in a document called the 'final appraisal determination' (FAD). This is submitted to NICE for approval.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Consultees have a chance to appeal against the final recommendations in the FAD. If there are no appeals, the final recommendations become the basis of the guidance that NICE issues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who Is on the Appraisal Committee?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;NICE technology appraisal recommendations are prepared by an independent committee. This includes health professionals working in the NHS and people who are familiar with the issues affecting patients and carers. Although the Appraisal Committee seeks the views of organisations representing health professionals, patients, carers, manufacturers and government, its advice is independent of any vested interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="146" OrdBy="450" ID="415" Name="Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not applicable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="148" OrdBy="460" ID="417" Name="Cost Analysis" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The manufacturer developed a Markov model simulating patients with acute ischaemic stroke who do or do not receive alteplase within 4.5 hours of onset of symptoms. Patients were modelled through 3 possible health states: independent, dependent and dead. The independent state was defined by a modified Rankin scale score of 0&amp;ndash;2 and the dependent state by a modified Rankin scale score of 3&amp;ndash;5. The model had 3 time phases: from 0 to 6 months when the model assumed the treatment effect of alteplase was complete at 90 days and maintained at 6 months; from 6 to 12 months when the model assumed no further treatment effect; and beyond 12 months when the model also assumed no further treatment effect from alteplase. However, beyond 12 months the model assumed that people in the dependent or independent states could have a recurrent stroke. The model also assumed that people in the dependent state at 12 months and beyond do not move to an independent state, and that people in the independent state at 12 months and beyond do not move to a dependent state unless they survive a recurrent stroke. The model assumed a lifetime horizon with a cycle length of 6 months for the first 12 months, followed by cycles of 12 months thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary of Appraisal Committee's Key Conclusions on the Manufacturer's Economic Model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Availability and Nature of Evidence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Committee noted that the model structure and many of the input parameters were identical to those used in the economic model for the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) technology appraisal guidance 122 (0 to 3-hour window) and agreed that this approach was appropriate. The Committee concluded that the economic model adhered to the NICE reference case for economic analysis and the modelling approach was reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Uncertainties Around and Plausibility of Assumptions and Inputs in the Economic Model&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Committee noted that the manufacturer had assumed that the relative treatment effect of alteplase was maintained beyond 90 days up to 6 months in the model with no longer-term survival benefit beyond this point. The Committee considered that this may have been a conservative approach if alteplase offers a survival advantage compared with placebo beyond 6 months, a proposition the Committee found plausible, although not currently proven statistically, given that alteplase was associated with a reduction in death or dependence at 90 days.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Incorporation of Health-Related Quality-of-Life Benefits and Utility Values&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Committee was aware that the utility values were not adjusted over time in the model, which may have overestimated the quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) accrued by people in the independent health state and therefore biased the results in favour of alteplase. However, the Committee considered that this was not a crucial limitation of the model because the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were not sensitive to changes in the utility values in the manufacturer's sensitivity analyses, and therefore any downward adjustment over time would have had a small impact on the ICERs. The Committee was also aware that the manufacturer assumed that people who had a symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage in the economic model incurred the additional one-off cost of a computed tomography scan but experienced no further disutility beyond that captured in the dependent or independent health states. The Committee heard from the clinical specialists that this assumption was reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What Are the Key Drivers of Cost Effectiveness?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The ICERs were robust to changes in most input parameters, except for the relative risks of death and death or dependence for treatment with alteplase applied in the first phase of the model.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Most Likely Cost-effectiveness Estimate (Given as an ICER)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Committee agreed that alteplase either dominated standard care or had an ICER below &amp;pound;10,000 per QALY gained depending on the time-to-treatment window considered. The Committee concluded that treating acute ischaemic stroke with alteplase within 0 to 4.5 hours of onset of stroke symptoms was a cost-effective use of National Health Service resources.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Refer to Sections 3 and 4 of the original guideline document for additional information on cost-effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="104" OrdBy="465" ID="418" Name="Method of Guideline Validation" Type="picklist-choice"><FieldValue Value="External Peer Review" /></Field><Field FieldID="130" OrdBy="470" ID="419" Name="Description of Method of Guideline Validation" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consultee organizations from the following groups were invited to comment on the draft scope, Assessment Report and the Appraisal Consultation Document (ACD) and were provided with the opportunity to appeal against the Final Appraisal Determination.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Manufacturer/sponsors&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Professional/specialist and patient/carer groups&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Commentator organisations (without the right of appeal)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition, individuals selected from clinical expert and patient advocate nominations from the professional/specialist and patient/carer groups were also invited to comment on the ACD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field></Section><Section SecID="420" OrdBy="500" Name="Recommendations"><Field FieldID="151" OrdBy="505" ID="421" Name="Major Recommendations" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This guidance replaces National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) technology appraisal guidance 122 (published in June 2007).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Alteplase is recommended within its marketing authorisation for treating acute ischaemic stroke in adults if:&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;li&gt;Treatment is started as early as possible within 4.5 hours of onset of stroke symptoms, and &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;li&gt;Intracranial haemorrhage has been excluded by appropriate imaging techniques. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The Committee concluded that alteplase administered between 3 and 4.5 hours after onset of stroke symptoms was an effective treatment for acute ischaemic stroke because it decreased the probability of disability. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The Committee concluded that alteplase administered between 0 and 4.5 hours after onset of stroke symptoms was an effective treatment for acute ischaemic stroke because it decreased the probability of death or dependence. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The Committee agreed that alteplase either dominated standard care or had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) below &amp;pound;10,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained depending on the time-to-treatment window considered.

When a NICE technology appraisal recommends use of a drug or treatment, or other technology, the NHS must usually provide funding and resources for it within 3 months of the guidance being published. If the Department of Health issues a variation to the 3-month funding direction, details will be available on the NICE website. When there is no NICE technology appraisal guidance on a drug, treatment or other technology, decisions on funding should be made locally. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The technology in this appraisal may not be the only treatment for acute ischaemic stroke recommended in NICE guidance, or otherwise available in the NHS. Therefore, if a NICE technology appraisal recommends use of a technology, it is as an option for the treatment of a disease or condition. This means that the technology should be available for a patient who meets the clinical criteria set out in the guidance, subject to the clinical judgement of the treating clinician. The NHS must provide funding and resources (in line with the section above) when the clinician concludes and the patient agrees that the recommended technology is the most appropriate to use, based on a discussion of all available treatments. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;NICE has developed tools to help organisations put this guidance into practice (listed below).
