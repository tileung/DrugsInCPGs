Clinical databases were searched using relevant medical subject headings, free-text terms and study type filters where appropriate. Studies published in languages other than English were not reviewed. All searches were conducted on core databases, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and The Cochrane Library. All searches were updated on 29th November 2010 and no papers were included beyond this date.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Search strategies were checked by looking at reference lists of relevant key papers, checking search strategies in other systematic reviews and asking the GDG for known studies. The questions, the study types applied, the databases searched and the years covered can be found in 'Appendix C: Literature search strategies' in the full version of the original guideline document.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;During the scoping stage, a search was conducted for guidelines and reports on the websites listed below and via organisations relevant to the topic. Searching for grey literature or unpublished literature was not undertaken. All references sent by stakeholders were considered.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Guidelines International Network database (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.g-i-n.net&quot; title=&quot;GIN web site&quot;&gt;www.g-i-n.net&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;National Guideline Clearinghouse (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guideline.gov/&quot; title=&quot;NGC web site&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;www.guideline.gov/&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nice.org.uk&quot; title=&quot;NICE web site&quot;&gt;www.nice.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Program (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.consensus.nih.gov/&quot; title=&quot;NIH Consensus Development web site&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;consensus.nih.gov/&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;National Library for Health (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.library.nhs.uk/&quot; title=&quot;National Library for Health web site&quot;&gt;www.library.nhs.uk/&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Call for Evidence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The GDG decided to initiate a 'call for evidence' for meta-analyses, based on a systematic review, that include studies that use ambulatory blood pressure measurement as the reference standard and report sensitivity and specificity of home and/or clinic blood pressure measurement, as they believed that important evidence existed that would not be identified by the standard searches. The NCGC contacted all registered stakeholders and asked them to submit any relevant published or unpublished evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inclusion/Exclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See 'Appendix E: Review protocols' in the full version of the original guideline document for further details.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Research Fellow:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Identified potentially relevant studies for each review question from the relevant search results by reviewing titles and abstracts &amp;ndash; full papers were then obtained. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Reviewed full papers against pre-specified inclusion/exclusion criteria to identify studies that addressed the review question in the appropriate population and reported on outcomes of interest (review protocols are included in 'Appendix E: Review protocols' in the full version of the original guideline document). &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Health Economic Literature Search&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Systematic literature searches were also undertaken to identify health economic evidence within published literature relevant to the review questions. The evidence was identified by conducting a broad search relating to the guideline population in the National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED), the Health Economic Evaluations Database (HEED) and health technology assessment (HTA) databases from 2003 onwards to find anything published since the original guideline. There were two questions not covered in either the original guideline or the previous rapid update, for which additional searches with no date restrictions were carried out. Additionally, the search was run on MEDLINE and EMBASE, with a specific economic filter, from 2009, to ensure recent publications that had not yet been indexed by these databases were identified. Studies published in languages other than English were not reviewed. Where possible, searches were restricted to articles published in English language. The search strategies for health economics are included in 'Appendix D: Literature search strategies' in the full version of the original guideline document. All searches were updated on 29th November 2010. No papers published after this date were considered.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Call for Evidence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The GDG decided to initiate a 'call for evidence' for cost-effectiveness analyses from a United Kingdom (UK) perspective, using methods in line with the NICE reference case, comparing ambulatory, home and clinic blood pressure measurement in the diagnosis of hypertension, as they believed that important evidence existed that would not be identified by the standard searches. The NCGC contacted all registered stakeholders and asked them to submit any relevant published or unpublished evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inclusion/Exclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Full economic evaluations (studies comparing costs and health consequences of alternative courses of action: cost-utility, cost-effectiveness, cost-benefit and cost-consequence analyses) and comparative costing studies that addressed the review question in the relevant population were considered potentially applicable as economic evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Studies were excluded if they only reported cost per hospital (not per patient), or only reported average cost effectiveness without disaggregated costs and effects. Abstracts, posters, reviews, letters/editorials, foreign language publications and unpublished studies were excluded. Studies judged to have an applicability rating of 'not applicable' were excluded (this included studies that took the perspective of a non-Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD] country).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Remaining studies were prioritised for inclusion based on their relative applicability to the development of this guideline and the study limitations. For example, if a high quality, directly applicable UK analysis was available other less relevant studies may have been excluded and this is noted in the relevant section.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For more details about the assessment of applicability and methodological quality see the economic evaluation checklist (The Guidelines Manual, Appendix H and the health economics research protocol in 'Appendix E: Review protocols' in the full version of the original guideline document.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When no relevant economic analyses were identified in the economic literature review, relevant UK NHS unit costs were presented to the GDG to inform consideration of cost effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="136" OrdBy="415" ID="408" Name="Number of Source Documents" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not stated&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="115" OrdBy="420" ID="409" Name="Methods Used to Assess the Quality and Strength of the Evidence" Type="picklist-choice"><FieldValue Value="Weighting According to a Rating Scheme (Scheme Given)" /></Field><Field FieldID="149" OrdBy="425" ID="410" Name="Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall Quality of Outcome Evidence in Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;1&quot; summary=&quot;Table: Overall Quality of Outcome Evidence in Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE)&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;thead&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;tr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;th valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Level&lt;/th&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;th valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;/tr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/thead&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;tbody&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;tr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;High&lt;/td&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Further research is very unlikely to change confidence in the estimate of effect &lt;/td&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;/tr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;tr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Moderate&lt;/td&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Further research is likely to have an important impact on&amp;nbsp;confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate &lt;/td&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;/tr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;tr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Low&lt;/td&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Further research is very likely to have an important impact on confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate &lt;/td&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;/tr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;tr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Very low&lt;/td&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Any estimate of effect is very uncertain&lt;/td&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;/tr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/tbody&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="116" OrdBy="430" ID="411" Name="Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence" Type="picklist-many"><FieldValue Value="Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials" /><FieldValue Value="Review of Published Meta-Analyses" /><FieldValue Value="Systematic Review with Evidence Tables" /></Field><Field FieldID="150" OrdBy="435" ID="412" Name="Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)&lt;/strong&gt;: This guideline was developed by the Newcastle Guideline Development and Research Unit and updated by the National Clinical Guideline Centre (formerly the National Collaborating Centre for Chronic Conditions) and the British Hypertension Society.

Where reported, time-to-event data was presented as a hazard ratio for the following binary outcomes: mortality, stroke, MI, heart failure, new onset diabetes, vascular procedures, angina requiring hospitalisation, study drug withdrawal. The continuous outcome blood pressure (mmHg)] was analysed using an inverse variance method for pooling weighted mean differences and where the studies had different scales, standardised mean differences were used. No quality of life outcome data was reported by any of the studies included in the 2012 update reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Statistical heterogeneity was assessed by considering the chi-squared test for significance at p&amp;lt;0.1 or an I-squared inconsistency statistic of &amp;gt;50% to indicate significant heterogeneity. Where significant heterogeneity was present, we carried out sensitivity analysis based on the quality of studies, with particular attention paid to allocation concealment, blinding and loss to follow-up (missing data). In cases where there was inadequate allocation concealment, unclear blinding, high loss to follow-up (&amp;ge;20% missing data for studies &amp;le;2 years follow-up and &amp;ge;30% for those with &amp;gt;2 years follow-up) or differential missing data, this was examined in a sensitivity analysis. For the latter, the duration of follow up was also taken into consideration prior to including in a sensitivity analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Assessments of potential differences in effect between subgroups were based on the chi-squared tests for heterogeneity statistics between subgroups. If no sensitivity analysis was found to completely resolve statistical heterogeneity then a random effects (DerSimonian and Laird) model was also explored to provide a more conservative estimate of the effect.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The means and standard deviations of continuous outcomes were required for meta-analysis. However, in cases where standard deviations were not reported, the standard error was calculated if the p-values or 95% confidence intervals were reported and meta-analysis was undertaken with the mean and standard error using the generic inverse variance method in Cochrane Review Manager (RevMan5) software. Where p values were reported as 'less than', a conservative approach was undertaken. For example, if the p value was reported as 'p&amp;le;0.001', the calculations for standard deviations will be based on a p value of 0.001. If these statistical measures were un available then the methods described in section 16.1.3 of the Cochrane Handbook 'Missing standard deviations' were applied as the last resort.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appraising the Quality of Evidence by Outcomes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The evidence for outcomes from the included randomised clinical trial (RCT) studies were evaluated and presented using an adaptation of the 'Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) toolbox' developed by the international GRADE working group (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org/&quot; title=&quot;GRADE web site&quot;&gt;http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org/&lt;/a&gt;). The software (GRADEpro) developed by the GRADE working group was used to assess the quality of each outcome, taking into account individual study quality and the meta-analysis results. The summary of findings was presented as an 'evidence profile', a single table that includes details of the quality assessment as well as pooled outcome data, where appropriate, an absolute measure of intervention effect and the summary of quality of evidence for that outcome. In this table, the columns for intervention and control indicate the sum of the sample size for continuous outcomes. For binary outcomes such as number of patients with an adverse event, the event rates (n/N: number of patients with events divided by sum of number of patients) are shown with percentages. Reporting or publication bias was only taken into consideration in the quality assessment and included in the Clinical Study Characteristics table if it was apparent.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Each outcome was examined separately for the quality elements listed and defined in Table 1 and each graded using the quality levels listed in Table 2: 'The main criteria considered in the rating of these elements in the full version of the original guideline document. Footnotes were used to describe reasons for grading a quality element as having serious or very serious problems. The ratings for each component were summed to obtain an overall assessment for each outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grading the Quality of Clinical Evidence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After results were pooled, the overall quality of evidence for each outcome was considered. The procedure adopted when using GRADE is specified in the full version of the original guideline document, as are the methods of dealing with study limitations, inconsistencies, indirectness, and imprecision.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prognostic Studies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All prognostic study designs were included for the prognostic questions. The quality of the prognostic studies was assessed using the quality checklist in the NICE Guidelines Manual April 2009. The main criteria considered in assessing study quality were:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The study sample represents the population of interest with regard to key characteristics, sufficient to limit potential bias to the results. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Loss to follow-up is unrelated to key characteristics (that is, the study data adequately represent the sample), sufficient to limit potential bias. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The prognostic factor of interest is adequately measured in study participants, sufficient to limit potential bias. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The outcome of interest is adequately measured in study participants, sufficient to limit bias. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Important potential confounders are appropriately accounted for, limiting potential bias with respect to the prognostic factor of interest. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The statistical analysis is appropriate for the design of the study, limiting potential for the presentation of invalid results. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The methodological flaws of the prognostic studies included in the guideline update have been summarised in tables within Appendix F in the full version of the original guideline document, in order to give an overview of the quality of each individual study, since GRADE is not currently designed for prognostic studies. Odds ratios, relative risks or hazard ratios, with their 95% confidence intervals, from multivariate analyses were extracted from the papers. Data for selected outcomes has been summarised in tables within the relevant review chapter. Full data for all the outcomes has been reported in the evidence tables (see Appendix F in the full version of the original guideline document) for each individual prognostic study. Taking into consideration the advice on prognostic reviews in the NICE guidelines manual, meta-analysis was not undertaken for prognostic studies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Evidence of Cost Effectiveness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Health Economist:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Identified potentially relevant studies for each review question from the economic search results by reviewing titles and abstracts &amp;ndash; full papers were then obtained. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Reviewed full papers against pre-specified inclusion/exclusion criteria to identify relevant studies (see below for details). &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Critically appraised relevant studies using the economic evaluations checklist as specified in The Guidelines Manual. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Extracted key information about the study's methods and results into evidence tables (evidence tables are included in 'Appendix G: Evidence tables &amp;ndash; health economic studies' in the full version of the original guideline document). &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Generated summaries of the evidence in NICE economic evidence profiles (included in the relevant chapter write-ups) &amp;ndash; see below for details. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NICE Economic Evidence Profiles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The NICE economic evidence profile has been used to summarise cost and cost-effectiveness estimates. The economic evidence profile shows, for each economic study, an assessment of applicability and methodological quality, with footnotes indicating the reasons for the assessment. These assessments were made by the health economist using the economic evaluation checklist from The Guidelines Manual, Appendix H. It also shows incremental costs, incremental outcomes (for example, quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]) and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio from the primary analysis, as well as information about the assessment of uncertainty in the analysis. See Table 7 in the full version of the original guideline document for more details.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If a non-UK study was included in the profile, the results were converted into pounds sterling using the appropriate purchasing power parity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Undertaking New Health Economic Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As well as reviewing the published economic literature for each review question, as described above, new cost-effectiveness analysis was undertaken by the Health Economist in priority areas. Priority areas were agreed by the GDG after formation of the review questions and consideration of the available health economic evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Additional data for the analysis were identified as required through additional literature searches undertaken by the Health Economist, and discussion with the GDG.

In fact, ABPM was cost saving compared to CBPM when long term costs were taken into account. The key driver of cost savings with ABPM compared to CBPM was hypertension treatment costs avoided due to more accurate diagnosis (increased specificity). Results are summarised in Table 19 of the full version of the original guideline document.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In most subgroups ABPM was associated with higher quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), as well as lower costs, than CBPM and HBPM (that is ABPM was the dominant option). The exception was in the subgroups with starting age 40 years and the female subgroup with &lt;span&gt;starting&lt;/span&gt; age 50 years, where ABPM still had lower costs but was associated with a small reduction in QALYs; however, ABPM was still the most cost effective option in these scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The conclusion that ABPM is cost-effective compared to CBPM and HBPM was robust to a wide range of sensitivity analyses including those varying the cost of ABPM. As might be expected, the conclusion was sensitive to changes to the accuracy of diagnosis with each method and in some scenarios HBPM became the most cost-effective option. The conclusion was somewhat sensitive to the assumption that check-ups for those diagnosed without hypertension are undertaken every 5 years; in the two lower age subgroups HBPM became cost-effective when check-ups were done annually. The conclusion was also sensitive to the assumption that people who were not hypertensive but were treated did not receive benefits from treatment; when non-hypertensive people also received a risk reduction from treatment, CBPM became the most cost-effective option as there was no benefit to misdiagnosing people.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treatment of People Aged 80 Years and Greater&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One partially applicable study with potentially serious limitations found treating people over 80 years of age with hypertension was cost-effective compared to not treating them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitoring Treatment Efficacy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No cost-effectiveness analyses were identified incorporating all of CBPM, ABPM and HBPM in the assessment of response to treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One partially applicable study with potentially serious limitations found that in a population diagnosed with hypertension using CBPM, monitoring response to treatment and adjusting treatment using HBPM was cost saving compared to CBPM; blood pressure control was however worse.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treatment Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Conclusions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This analysis found that treating hypertension is highly cost-effective. Treatment resulted in improved health outcomes (higher QALYs) with all of the drug classes in the model and actually resulted in overall cost savings compared to no treatment as the reduction in cardiovascular events led to savings that offset the relatively low cost of antihypertensive medication; although it should be noted that this is based on low cost generic drugs. In most people calcium channel blockers (CCBs) were found to be the most cost-effective treatment option for initial treatment of essential hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In terms of how the analysis has changed in 2011 since 2006, the most significant change in the model inputs in the 2011 update was the reduction in drugs costs; in particular the cost of CCBs, angiotensin converting enzymes (ACEs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). CCBs remained the most cost effective option, meaning no change from 2006 in the interpretation of the base-case result in terms of overall cost effectiveness. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) for CCBs did however reduce considerably (from &amp;pound;12,250 to &amp;pound;1,960) making CCBs more cost effective than they were in 2006. CCBs are also no longer the most expensive option, both beta-blockers (B) and no intervention (NI) being more expensive, meaning that CCBs are now cost saving compared to NI; this was not the case in the 2006 guideline. Another key difference is that the absolute difference between ACEs/ARBs, CCBs and thiazide diuretics (TDs) is now much smaller than it was in 2006 with BBs even less cost effective. The results of the subgroup analysis remain largely unchanged apart from that in both men and women, CCBs are cost effective a greater percentage of the time compared with TDs in higher cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk and older age groups; however this difference is not very large. Both old and new analyses show similar trends of cost effectiveness but the new analysis has ACE/ARB cost effective in fewer scenarios than before with the heart failure risk where this is the case moving to intermediate/high risk.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The considerations that were highlighted in the 2006 guideline are still relevant and are described below.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The trials on which the cost-effectiveness calculations are based did not, in general, show large differences in clinical outcomes between drug classes. Some of the outcomes have point estimates of effect that are not statistically significant. In these situations the point estimate is used as the best estimate of effect and so effects that are not statistically significant have a bearing on the relative cost effectiveness. Where the outcomes have a large effect on quality of life or cost (for example, stroke or death) the effect on overall cost effectiveness may be relatively important. The guideline development group (GDG) considered the effect of this uncertainty about important outcomes in reaching their conclusions. The relative cost effectiveness of the agents also depends on the propensity of patients treated with them to develop new-onset diabetes or heart failure. The GDG were aware that both of these adverse outcomes should be treated with some caution in this context. It is not clear that an elevated blood glucose developing as a consequence of drug treatment has the same long-term health impact as in other circumstances, and the same applies to heart failure diagnoses, particularly since the definition of this outcome in some studies would not satisfy currently accepted criteria.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The applicability of the model to people under the age of 55 is uncertain, since it is based on trial data from mostly older people. However, sensitivity analysis showed that the drugs that affect the renin-angiotensin system are likely to be the most cost-effective option in this group if they are even slightly more effective in the young than is suggested from the overall trial data.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These results are sensitive to the cost of CCBs. The more expensive brands are not likely to be cost effective for use in the NHS. For example, the model estimates that for 65-year-olds at 2% annual CVD risk, 1.1% diabetes risk and 1% heart failure risk CCBs are only cost effective if they cost less than &amp;pound;94 per patient per year.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, it should be emphasised that there is still considerable uncertainty about the size of some treatment effects, which translates into uncertainty about the relative cost-effectiveness of the drugs. The evidence base is also difficult to interpret because of the complex nature of some of the treatment protocols and also because of differences in some of the trial populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="104" OrdBy="465" ID="418" Name="Method of Guideline Validation" Type="picklist-choice"><FieldValue Value="External Peer Review" /><FieldValue Value="Internal Peer Review" /></Field><Field FieldID="130" OrdBy="470" ID="419" Name="Description of Method of Guideline Validation" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guideline was validated through two consultations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The first draft of the guideline (the full guideline, National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence [NICE] guideline, and Quick Reference Guide) were consulted with Stakeholders and comments were considered by the Guideline Development Group (GDG) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The final consultation draft of the full guideline, the NICE guideline and the Information for the Public were submitted to stakeholders for final comments. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The final draft was submitted to the Guideline Review Panel for review prior to publication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field></Section><Section SecID="420" OrdBy="500" Name="Recommendations"><Field FieldID="151" OrdBy="505" ID="421" Name="Major Recommendations" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)&lt;/strong&gt;: The original 2004 guideline was developed by the Newcastle Guideline Development and Research Unit.
