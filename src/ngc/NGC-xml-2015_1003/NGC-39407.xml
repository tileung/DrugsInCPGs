For some articles, Web of Science, a literature citation database, was used when it was desirable to find literature that cited a particular article. Relevant evidence statements from Cochrane and British Medical Journal (BMJ) Clinical Evidence were reviewed. Selected guidelines/systematic reviews were also reviewed. The reference lists from other literature and tables of contents from related journals were scanned for relevant articles. Suggestions from various volunteer advisory bodies to the Division of Workers' Compensation were solicited.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Literature reviewed was in English. Literature searches were limited according to study type and human adults. Only randomized controlled trials or meta-analyses were used for evidence statements regarding treatment. Diagnostic accuracy studies were critiqued for diagnostic testing evidence and cohort, cross-sectional and case-control studies were critiqued for causation evidence statements. Literature which did not meet requirements for evidence statements could be referenced if it furnished useful background information or described interventions which are considered generally accepted by a consensus of health care providers. This information sometimes contributed to consensus decisions by the multi-disciplinary task force drafting the guidelines. Literature that was determined to be unrelated to the clinical issue, or which had such poor quality on initial review that it could not qualify for evidence nor provide meaningful input was not critiqued. All articles sent by the public were formally reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specific Search Strategy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The literature search included articles published from 2003 to 2010, in order to incorporate literature published since the previous guidelines revision. Some searches incorporated a broader range of dates to address input from stakeholders. The literature search was conducted from approximately August 2009 until February 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Search terms: Carpal tunnel syndrome, DeQuervain's, Thumb osteoarthritis, Wrist osteoarthritis, Medial epicondylitis, Lateral epicondylitis, Cubital tunnel syndrome, TFCC injury, Wrist tendonitis, Trigger finger, Guyon Canal (Tunnel) syndrome, Posterior interosseous nerve entrapment, Pronator syndrome, Radial tunnel syndrome, Nerve gliding, Low level laser, Viscosupplementation, Prolotherapy, Platelet-rich plasma, Autologous whole blood, Extra corporeal shockwave therapy, Botulinum toxin, Cumulative trauma disorder and upper extremity, Carpal tunnel syndrome epidemiology, Medial and lateral epicondylitis epidemiology, Cubital tunnel syndrome epidemiology, Radial tunnel syndrome epidemiology, DeQuervain's epidemiology, Trigger finger epidemiology, Wrist extensor &amp;amp; flexor tendonitis epidemiology, TFCC epidemiology, Pronator syndrome epidemiology, Posterior interosseous nerve entrapment epidemiology, Guyon canal (tunnel) syndrome epidemiology&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medical Literature Review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Articles are selected for review based on relevance and informativeness after viewing their titles and abstracts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="136" OrdBy="415" ID="408" Name="Number of Source Documents" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not stated&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="115" OrdBy="420" ID="409" Name="Methods Used to Assess the Quality and Strength of the Evidence" Type="picklist-choice"><FieldValue Value="Subjective Review" /></Field><Field FieldID="149" OrdBy="425" ID="410" Name="Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not applicable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="116" OrdBy="430" ID="411" Name="Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence" Type="picklist-many"><FieldValue Value="Review of Published Meta-Analyses" /><FieldValue Value="Systematic Review" /></Field><Field FieldID="150" OrdBy="435" ID="412" Name="Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medical Literature Review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Published journal articles are selected to be critiqued by the Research Methodologist prior to distribution. Unpublished articles or office handouts submitted by Task Force members or the public are reviewed and critiqued by the Medical Director and Research Methodologist, who then communicate directly with the submitting individual regarding quality and relevance. The submitting individual retains the prerogative of distributing the material to the Task Force. Other unspecified material and public commentary received or solicited by the Division is reviewed and critiqued, as appropriate, and distributed at the discretion of the Medical Director and Medical Policy staff. Many articles are included in the bibliography without critiques or assessment for evidence. These articles are considered to provide pertinent information whether or not they lend themselves to formal evaluation for levels of evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Where applicable, literature was given a designation of one of the following: High quality, adequate, inadequate, or not applicable. Literature with these designations is noted in the bibliography (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field). Literature that was designated as &quot;Adequate&quot; or &quot;High Quality&quot; is in bold font in the bibliography. Each designation was assigned in accordance with the related Study Questions (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Literature that was used to support evidence statements (e.g., some, good, strong) is listed in the bibliography. Over 450 articles and literature were examined for consideration during the course of this update. A limited number of those articles qualified for evidence statements. The designated strength of the evidence may not coincide with acceptability of treatment. When the evidence is conflicting or inconclusive, acceptability of treatment is determined by a combination of available medical literature and group consensus. Some of the elements that are considered in making these determinations are: level of functional benefit, acceptable risk/morbidity/mortality, and acceptable cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="112" OrdBy="440" ID="413" Name="Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations" Type="picklist-choice"><FieldValue Value="Expert Consensus" /></Field><Field FieldID="145" OrdBy="445" ID="414" Name="Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guidelines Updating Process&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The State of Colorado Division of Workers' Compensation Medical Treatment Guidelines updating process is completed in several stages.

See the original guideline document for additional information on initial evaluation and diagnostic procedures for patients with cumulative trauma conditions (CTCs) and for further descriptions of the therapies discussed below. See the original guideline document also for operative and non-operative treatment strategies designed to correlate with specific cumulative trauma conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Therapeutic Procedures&amp;mdash;Non-operative&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Treating providers as well as employers and insurers are highly encouraged to reference the General Guidelines Principles (Section B in the original guideline document) prior to initiation of any therapeutic procedure. All treatment plans should include frequency, duration with specific treatment milestones that are expected that would support ongoing use of the intervention for the specific duration. Before initiation of any therapeutic procedure, the authorized treating provider, employer, and insurer must consider these important issues in the care of the injured worker.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, patients undergoing therapeutic procedure(s) should be released or returned to modified- or restricted-duty during their rehabilitation at the earliest appropriate time. Refer to &quot;Return-to-Work&quot; below for detailed information.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second, cessation and/or review of treatment modalities should be undertaken when no further significant subjective or objective improvement in the patient's condition is noted. If patients are not responding within the recommended duration periods, alternative treatment interventions, further diagnostic studies, or consultations should be pursued. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Third, providers should provide and document education to the patient. No treatment plan is complete without addressing issues of individual and/or group patient education as a means of facilitating self-management of symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, formal psychological or psychosocial evaluation should be performed on patients not making expected progress within 6 to 12 weeks following injury and whose subjective symptoms do not correlate with objective signs and tests.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In cases where a patient is unable to attend an outpatient center, home therapy may be necessary. Home therapy may include active and passive therapeutic procedures as well as other modalities to assist in alleviating pain, swelling, and abnormal muscle tone. Home therapy is usually of short duration and continues until the patient is able to tolerate coming to an outpatient center.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The following procedures are listed in alphabetical order.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acupuncture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Acupuncture is an accepted and widely used procedure for the relief of pain and inflammation in cumulative trauma conditions. While it is commonly used when pain medication is reduced or not tolerated, it may be used as an adjunct to physical rehabilitation and/or surgical intervention to hasten the return of functional activity. Acupuncture should be performed by licensed practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Acupuncture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Acupuncture is the insertion and removal of filiform needles to stimulate acupoints (acupuncture points). Needles may be inserted, manipulated, and retained for a period of time. Acupuncture can be used to reduce pain and inflammation, increase blood flow, increase range-of-motion, decrease the side effects of medication-induced nausea, promote relaxation in an anxious patient, and reduce muscle spasm. Indications include joint pain, joint stiffness, soft tissue pain and inflammation, paresthesia, post-surgical pain relief, muscle spasm, and scar tissue pain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Acupuncture with Electrical Stimulation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Acupuncture with electrical stimulation is the use of electrical current (microamperage or milli-amperage) on the needles at the acupuncture site. It is used to increase effectiveness of the needles by continuous stimulation of the acupoint. Physiological effects (depending on location and settings) can include endorphin release for pain relief, reduction of inflammation, increased blood circulation, analgesia through interruption of pain stimulus, and muscle relaxation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is indicated to treat chronic pain conditions, radiating pain along a nerve pathway, muscle spasm, inflammation, scar tissue pain, and pain located in multiple sites.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Treatment beyond 14 treatments must be documented with respect to need and ability to facilitate positive symptomatic or functional gains. Such care should be re-evaluated and documented with each series of treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Other Acupuncture Modalities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Acupuncture treatment is based on individual patient needs and therefore treatment may include a combination of procedures to enhance treatment effect. Other procedures may include the use of heat, soft tissue manipulation/massage, and exercise. Refer to &quot;Therapy&amp;ndash;Active&quot; and &quot;Therapy&amp;ndash;Passive&quot; below.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biofeedback&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Biofeedback is a form of behavioral medicine that helps patients learn self-awareness and self-regulation skills for the purpose of gaining greater control of their physiology, such as muscle activity, brain waves, and measures of autonomic nervous system activity. It is an accepted treatment. Electronic instrumentation is used to monitor the targeted physiology and then displayed or fed back to the patient visually, auditorially, or tactilely, with coaching by a biofeedback specialist. Biofeedback is provided by clinicians certified in biofeedback and/or who have documented specialized education, advanced training, direct or supervised experience qualifying them to provide the specialized treatment needed (e.g., surface electromyogram [EMG], electroencephalograph [EEG], or other).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Treatment is individualized to the patient's work-related diagnosis and needs. Home practice of skills is required for mastery and may be facilitated by the use of home training tapes. The ultimate goal in biofeedback treatment is normalizing the physiology to the pre-injury status to the extent possible and involves transfer of learned skills to the workplace and daily life. Candidates for biofeedback therapy or training must be motivated to learn and practice biofeedback and self-regulation techniques.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Indications for biofeedback include individuals who are suffering from musculoskeletal injury in which muscle dysfunction or other physiological indicators of excessive or prolonged stress response affects and/or delays recovery. Other applications include training to improve self-management of emotional stress/pain responses such as anxiety, depression, anger, sleep disturbance, and other central and autonomic nervous system imbalances. Biofeedback is often utilized along with other treatment modalities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Injections&amp;ndash;Therapeutic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Therapeutic injections are generally accepted, well-established procedures that may play a significant role in the treatment of patients with upper extremity pain or pathology. Therapeutic injections involve the delivery of anesthetic and/or anti-inflammatory medications to the painful structure. Therapeutic injections have many potential benefits. Ideally, a therapeutic injection will: (a) reduce inflammation in a specific target area; (b) relieve secondary muscle spasm; and (c) diminish pain and support therapy directed to functional recovery. Diagnostic and therapeutic injections should be used early and selectively to establish a diagnosis and support rehabilitation. If injections are overused or used outside the context of a monitored rehabilitation program, they may be of significantly less value.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Indications &amp;ndash; Diagnostic injections are procedures which may be used to identify pain generators or pathology. For additional specific clinical indications, see Section F., &quot;Specific Musculoskeletal Diagnosis, Testing and Treatment Procedures,&quot; and Section G., &quot;Specific Peripheral Nerve Diagnosis, Testing and Treatment Procedures,&quot; in the original guideline document.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Special Considerations &amp;ndash; The use of injections has become progressively sophisticated. Each procedure considered has an inherent risk, and risk versus benefit should be evaluated when considering injection therapy. In addition, all injections must include sterile technique.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Contraindications &amp;ndash; General contraindications include local or systemic infection, bleeding disorders, allergy to medications used, and patient refusal. Specific contraindications may apply to individual injections.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Autologous Whole Blood Injections/Platelet-Rich Plasma Injections&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Autologous Whole Blood Injections&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Autologous whole blood injections are an inexpensive treatment and may be used in patients who have not made sufficient functional progress with initial therapy for lateral or medial epicondylitis after 10 to 12 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Platelet-rich Plasma Injections&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is good evidence, in literature on lateral epicondylitis, that for patients with symptoms lasting 6 months or more, platelet-rich plasma injections result in better pain and functional outcomes after 1 year than steroid injections.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Botulinum Toxin Injections&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The unit dosage varies significantly depending on the brand used. Usage for lateral and medial epicondylitis is not Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved at the time of this guideline writing. There is good evidence that botulinum toxin A injection may provide short-term pain relief from pain due to chronic (3 months or longer) lateral epicondylitis. However, the long-term functional benefits are unknown. There is also good evidence that botulinum toxin A injections cause weakness in finger extension and/or digit paresis. Additional complications may include: allergic reaction to medications, increased risk of systemic effects in patients with motor neuropathy or disorders of the neuromuscular junction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It should not be considered a first line of treatment. Other conservative measures should be tried first. Careful botulinum toxin dosing should be used to avoid complete paresis and maintain function and return to work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Botulinum toxin injections are listed in this guideline as a treatment option for lateral and medial epicondylitis. Prior authorization is required.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Steroid Injections&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Steroid injections, including joint, bursa, and peri-tendinous insertions, are well-established procedures with varying degrees of evidence depending on the diagnosis. Peri-tendinous injections under significant pressure should be avoided as the needle may be inadvertently penetrating the tendon. Injection into the tendon can cause tendon degeneration, tendon breakdown, or rupture. Injections should be used with caution for patients under 30 years of age. When performing peri-tendinous injections, the risk of tendon rupture should be discussed with the patient and the need for temporary restricted-duty emphasized.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Steroid injections should be used cautiously in diabetic patients. Diabetic patients should be reminded to check their blood-glucose level at least twice daily for 2 weeks post-injections.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is strong evidence in literature on lateral epicondylitis that steroid injection decreases pain in the first few weeks but has a worse outcome at 52 weeks than physical therapy (PT) or more conservative therapy including bracing, platelet-rich plasma injections, heat or cold therapy, and change in activities. The potential for negative long-term effects should be strongly considered. A program of physical rehabilitation in combination with judicious use of analgesic medications should be the core treatment for epicondylitis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trigger Point Injections&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although generally accepted, trigger point injections have only rare indications in the treatment of upper extremity disorders. Therefore, the Division does not recommend their routine use in the treatment of upper extremity injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Indications &amp;ndash; Trigger point injections may be used to relieve myofascial pain and facilitate active therapy and stretching of the affected areas. They are to be used as an adjunctive treatment in combination with other treatment modalities such as functional restoration programs. Trigger point injections should be utilized primarily for the purpose of facilitating functional progress. Patients should continue with a therapeutic exercise program as tolerated throughout the time period they are undergoing intensive myofascial interventions. Myofascial pain is often associated with other underlying structural problems, and any abnormalities need to be ruled out prior to injection.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Trigger point injections are indicated in those patients where well-circumscribed trigger points have been consistently observed, characteristic radiation of pain pattern and local autonomic reaction, such as persistent hyperemia following palpation. Generally, these injections are not necessary unless consistently observed trigger points are not responding to specific, noninvasive, myofascial interventions within approximately a 6 week time frame.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Complications &amp;ndash; Potential but rare complications of trigger point injections include infection, anaphylaxis, neurapraxia, and neuropathy. If corticosteroids are injected in addition to local anesthetic, there is a risk of developing local myopathy. Severe pain on injection suggests the possibility of an intraneural injection, and the needle should be immediately repositioned.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prolotherapy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also known as sclerotherapy, prolotherapy consists of peri-articular injections of hypertonic dextrose with or without phenol with the goal of inducing an inflammatory response that will recruit cytokine growth factors involved in the proliferation of connective tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The evidence in support of prolotherapy is insufficient and therefore, its use is not recommended in upper extremity injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Viscosupplementation/Intracapsular Acid Salts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is some evidence that intra-articular injection of high molecular weight hyaluronic acid is more effective than saline in improving function and pain at 6 months for osteoarthritis at the base of the thumb. There is no evidence that hyaluronate injections are superior to steroid injections for carpometacarpal (CMC) thumb arthritis. They may be tried after 3 months of conservative therapy, including steroid injections, has failed. At the time of this guidelines writing, Hylan G-F 20 has been FDA-approved for the treatment of pain due to osteoarthritis of the knee in patients who have failed to respond adequately to conservative non-pharmacologic therapy and simple analgesics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jobsite Alteration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Early evaluation and training of body mechanics and other ergonomic factors are essential for every injured worker and should be done by a qualified individual. Whenever a case is identified as a work-related cumulative trauma condition, job alterations are an expected treatment. These may be in the form of instructing the worker how specific duties might be performed to meet the ergonomic suggestions in the jobsite alteration section or in actual job worksite or duty changes. There is some evidence that early workplace intervention may prevent loss of work productivity, particularly when handling high physical loads. Therefore, employees presenting with pain or aching associated with ergonomic risks would benefit from having their work stations properly evaluated and adjusted as appropriate even when no workers compensation claim is accepted. In many cases, this requires a jobsite evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is no single factor or combination of factors that is proven to prevent or ameliorate CTC, but a combination of ergonomic and psychosocial factors are generally considered to be important. Ergonomic factors that may be considered include use of force, repetition, awkward positions, upper extremity vibration, cold environment, and contact pressure on the nerve. Psychosocial factors to be considered include pacing, degree of control over job duties, perception of job stress, and supervisory support.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Job evaluation and modification should include input from a health care professional with experience in ergonomics or a certified ergonomist; the employee; and the employer. The employee must be observed performing all job functions in order for the jobsite evaluation to be a valid representation of a typical workday. Periodic follow-up is recommended to assess the effectiveness of the intervention and need for additional ergonomic changes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because ergonomic changes are a required medical treatment for cumulative trauma conditions and the person performing the evaluations is a health care professional, it is assumed that the insurer will be responsible for paying for the jobsite evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The original guideline document provides additional information on the following topics related to jobsite alteration:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Interventions &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Seating description &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Job hazard checklist &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Tools &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medications and Medical Management&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Use of medications in the treatment of cumulative trauma related conditions is generally accepted for controlling acute pain and inflammation. Use of medications will vary widely due to the spectrum of injuries from simple strains to post-surgical analgesia. A thorough medication history, including use of alternative and over-the-counter medications, should be performed at the time of the initial visit and updated periodically. Treatment for pain control is initially accomplished with acetaminophen and/or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID). The patient should be educated regarding the interaction with prescription and over the counter medications as well as the contents of over the counter herbal products.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Oral NSAIDs and acetaminophen are useful in treating conditions associated with degenerative joint disease and/or inflammation. Topical medications may also be useful in controlling pain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Acetaminophen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Acetaminophen is an effective analgesic with antipyretic but not anti-inflammatory activity. Acetaminophen is generally well-tolerated, causes little gastrointestinal irritation but may be associated with stomach bleeding in at risk patients. Acetaminophen has been associated with liver toxicity in overdose situations or in chronic alcohol use. Patients may not realize that many over the counter preparations may contain acetaminophen. The total daily dose of acetaminophen is recommended not to exceed 4 grams per 24-hour period, from all sources, including narcotic acetaminophen combination preparations. Use of this substance long-term for 3 days per week or greater may be associated with rebound pain upon cessation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Minor Tranquilizer/Muscle Relaxants&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Minor tranquilizers/muscle relaxants may be appropriate for muscle spasm, mild pain, and sleep disorders; however, are rarely necessary to treat CTC. When prescribing these agents, physicians must seriously consider side effects of drowsiness or dizziness and the fact that benzodiazepines and some other muscle relaxants may be habit forming.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narcotics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Narcotics should be primarily reserved for the treatment of severe upper extremity pain. There are circumstances where prolonged use of narcotics is justified based upon specific diagnosis, and in these cases, it should be documented and justified. In mild-to-moderate cases of upper extremity pain, narcotic medication should be used cautiously on a case-by-case basis. Adverse effects include respiratory depression, the development of physical and psychological dependence, and impaired alertness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Narcotic medications should be prescribed with strict time, quantity, and duration guidelines, and with definitive cessation parameters. Pain is subjective in nature and should be evaluated using a pain scale and assessment of function to rate effectiveness of the narcotic prescribed. Any use beyond the maximum duration should be documented and justified based on the diagnosis and/or invasive procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NSAIDs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;NSAIDs are useful for pain and inflammation. In mild cases, they may be the only drugs required for analgesia. There are several classes of NSAIDs, and the response of the individual injured worker to a specific medication is unpredictable. For this reason, a range of NSAIDs may be tried in each case with the most effective preparation being continued. Patients should be closely monitored for adverse reactions. The FDA advises that many NSAIDs may cause an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and stroke, which can be fatal. Naproxen sodium does not appear to be associated with increased risk of vascular events. Administration of proton pump inhibitors, histamine 2 (H2) blockers, or prostaglandin analog misoprostol along with these NSAIDs may reduce the risk of duodenal and gastric ulceration but do not impact possible cardiovascular complications. Due to the cross-reactivity between aspirin and NSAIDs, NSAIDs should not be used in aspirin-sensitive patients, and should be used with caution in all asthma patients. NSAIDs are associated with abnormal renal function, including renal failure, as well as abnormal liver function. Certain NSAIDs may have interactions with various other medications. Individuals may have adverse events not listed above. Intervals for metabolic screening are dependent upon the patient's age, general health status and should be within parameters listed for each specific medication. Complete blood count (CBC) and liver and renal function should be monitored at least every 6 months in patients on chronic NSAIDs and initially when indicated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;NSAIDs may be used for pain management after joint replacement. They have also been used to reduce heterotopic ossification after arthroplasty. NSAIDs do reduce the radiographically documented heterotopic ossification in this setting, but there is some evidence in lower extremity cases that they do not improve functional outcomes and they may increase the risk of bleeding events in the post-operative period. Their routine use for prevention of heterotopic bone formation is not recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See the original guideline document for additional discussion of NSAIDs and acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) and selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oral Steroids&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Oral steroids have limited use but are accepted in cases requiring potent anti-inflammatory drug effect in carefully selected patients. A 1-week regimen of steroids may be considered in the treatment of patients who have arthritic flare-ups with significant inflammation of the joint.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), oral steroids have been shown to have short-term symptomatic benefit but no long-term functional benefit. There is good evidence that local steroid injection is superior to oral steroids at 3 months. Given this and the problematic systemic effects of oral steroids, they are not recommended for CTS. It may occasionally be appropriate to use them for patients with severe CTS symptoms who refuse injections and who have no risk factors for adverse effects.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The physician must be fully aware of potential contraindications for the use of all steroids such as hypertension, diabetes, glaucoma, peptic ulcer disease, etc., which should be discussed with the patient.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Psychotropic/Anti-anxiety/Hypnotic Agents&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Psychotropic/anti-anxiety/hypnotic agents may be useful for treatment of mild and chronic pain, dysesthesias, sleep disorders, and depression. Postoperative patients may receive medication to assure normal sleep cycles. Antidepressant medications, such as tricyclics and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), are useful for affective disorder and chronic pain management. Tricyclic antidepressant agents, in low dose, are useful for chronic pain but have more frequent side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anti-anxiety medications are best used for short-term treatment (i.e., less than 6 months). Accompanying sleep disorders are best treated with sedating antidepressants prior to bedtime. Frequently, combinations of the above agents are useful. As a general rule, physicians should access the patient's prior history of substance abuse or depression prior to prescribing any of these agents. Due to the habit-forming potential of the benzodiazepines and other drugs found in this class, they are not routinely recommended. Refer to the NGC summary of the Colorado Division of Workers' Compensation &lt;a href=&quot;/content.aspx?id=38441&quot; title=&quot;Guideline #9330&quot;&gt;Chronic pain disorder medical treatment guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, which give a detailed discussion regarding medication use in chronic pain management.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Topical Drug Delivery&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Creams and patches may be an alternative treatment of localized musculoskeletal disorders. They should only be considered for patients who cannot tolerate oral NSAIDs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is necessary that all topical agents be used with strict instructions for application as well as the maximum number of applications per day to obtain the desired benefit and avoid potential toxicity. As with all medications, patient selection must be rigorous to select those patients with the highest probability of compliance. Refer to &quot;Therapy&amp;ndash;Passive; Iontophoresis&quot; below for information regarding topical iontophoretic agents.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The original guideline document provides additional information on topical salicylates and nonsalicylates, capsaicin, topical glyceryl trinitrate, and topical lidocaine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vitamin B6&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Randomized trials on non-surgical treatment for CTS have demonstrated conflicting results. Higher doses may result in development of a toxic peripheral neuropathy. In the absence of definitive literature showing a beneficial effect, use of vitamin B6 cannot be recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occupational Rehabilitation Programs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Non-interdisciplinary&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These generally accepted programs are work-related, outcome focused, individualized treatment programs. Objectives of the program include, but are not limited to, improvement of cardiopulmonary and neuromusculoskeletal functions (strength, endurance, movement, flexibility, stability, and motor control functions), patient education, and symptom relief. The goal is for patients to gain full or optimal function and return to work. The service may include the time limited use of passive modalities with progression to achieve treatment and/or simulated/real work. Work conditioning and work simulation programs are discussed further in the original guideline document.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interdisciplinary&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These generally accepted programs are characterized by a variety of disciplines that participate in the assessment, planning, and/or implementation of an injured worker's program with the goal of the patient gaining full or optimal function and returning to work. There should be close interaction and integration among the disciplines to ensure that all members of the team interact to achieve team goals. These programs are for patients with greater levels of perceived disability, dysfunction, de-conditioning and psychological involvement. For patients with chronic pain, refer to NGC summary of the Division's &lt;a href=&quot;/content.aspx?id=38441&quot; title=&quot;Guideline #9330&quot;&gt;Chronic pain disorder medical treatment guidelines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Work hardening is an interdisciplinary program addressing a patient's employability and return-to-work. It includes a progressive increase in the number of hours per day that a patient completes work simulation tasks until the patient can tolerate a full workday. This is accomplished by addressing the medical, psychological, behavioral, physical, functional, and vocational components of employability and return-to-work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patient Education&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No treatment plan is complete without addressing issues of individual patient and/or group education as a means of prolonging the beneficial effects of treatment, as well as facilitating self-management of symptoms and injury prevention. Patient education is widely used, well-established, and generally well-accepted. The patient should take an active role in the establishment of functional outcome goals. He or she should be educated on his or her specific injury, assessment findings, and plan of treatment. Education and instruction in proper body mechanics, posture, positions to avoid task/tool adaptation, self-care for exacerbation of symptoms, and home exercise/task adaptation should also be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personality/Psychological/Psychosocial Intervention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Personality/psychological/psychosocial intervention is generally accepted, widely used, and well-established. This group of therapeutic and diagnostic modalities includes, but is not limited to, individual counseling, group therapy, stress management, psychosocial crises intervention, hypnosis, and meditation. Any screening or diagnostic workup should clarify and distinguish between pre-existing versus aggravated versus purely causative psychological conditions. Psychosocial intervention is recommended as an important component in the total management program that should be implemented as soon as the problem is identified. This can be used alone or in conjunction with other treatment modalities. Providers treating patients with chronic pain should refer to the NGC summary of the Division's &lt;a href=&quot;/content.aspx?id=38441&quot; title=&quot;Guideline #9330&quot;&gt;Chronic pain disorder medical treatment guidelines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Return-to-Work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Early return-to-work is generally accepted and should be a prime goal in treating occupational injuries given the poor return-to-work prognosis for an injured worker who has been out of work for more than 6 months. It is imperative that the patient be educated regarding the benefits of return-to-work, work restrictions, and follow-up if problems arise. When attempting to return a patient to work after a specific injury, clear objective restrictions of activity level should be made. An accurate job description with detailed physical duty restrictions is often necessary to assist the physician in making return-to-work recommendations. This may require a formal jobsite evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Employers should be prepared to offer transitional work. This may consist of temporary work in a less demanding position, return to the regular job with restrictions, or gradual return to the regular job. Company policies which encourage return-to-work with positive communication are most likely to have decreased worker disability.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Return-to-work is defined as any work or duty that the patient is able to perform safely. It may not be the patient's regular work. Due to the large spectrum of injuries of varying severity and varying physical demands in the work place, it is not possible to make specific return-to-work guidelines for each injury. Therefore, the Division recommends the following:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Establishment of a return-to-work status &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Establishment of activity level restrictions &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Compliance with activity level restrictions &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep Disturbances&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sleep disturbances are a common secondary symptom of CTCs. Although primary insomnia may accompany pain as an independent co-morbid condition, it more commonly occurs secondary to the pain condition itself. Exacerbations of pain often are accompanied by exacerbations of insomnia; the reverse can also occur.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Behavioral modifications are accepted interventions, easily implemented and can include:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Maintaining a regular sleep schedule, retiring and rising at approximately the same time on weekdays and weekends. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Avoiding daytime napping. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Avoiding caffeinated beverages after lunchtime. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Making the bedroom quiet and comfortable, eliminating disruptive lights, sounds, television sets, and keeping a bedroom temperature of about 65 degrees Fahrenheit. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Avoiding alcohol or nicotine within 2 hours of bedtime. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Avoiding large meals within 2 hours of bedtime. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Exercising vigorously during the day, but not within 2 hours of bedtime, since this may raise core temperature and activate the nervous system. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Associating the bed with sleep and sexual activity only, using other parts of the home for television, reading, and talking on the telephone. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Leaving the bedroom when unable to sleep for more than 20 minutes, returning to the bedroom when ready to sleep again. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These modifications should be undertaken before sleeping medication is prescribed for long-term use.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapy&amp;ndash;Active&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The following active therapies are widely used and accepted methods of care for a variety of work-related injuries. They are based on the philosophy that therapeutic exercise and/or activity are beneficial for restoring flexibility, strength, endurance, function, range of motion, and alleviating discomfort. Active therapy requires an internal effort by the individual to complete a specific exercise or task, and thus assists in developing skills promoting independence to allow self-care after discharge. This form of therapy requires supervision from a therapist or medical provider such as verbal, visual, and/or tactile instructions. At times a provider may help stabilize the patient or guide the movement pattern but the energy required to complete the task is predominately executed by the patient.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Patients should be instructed to continue active therapies at home as an extension of the treatment process in order to maintain improvement levels. Follow-up visits to reinforce and monitor progress and proper technique are recommended. Home exercise can include exercise with or without mechanical assistance or resistance and functional activities with assistive devices.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The following active therapies and modalities are listed in alphabetical order.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Activities of Daily Living (ADL)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;ADLs are well-established interventions which involve instruction, active-assisted training, and/or adaptation of activities or equipment to improve a person's capacity in normal daily activities such as self-care, work re-integration training, homemaking, and driving.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Functional Activities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Functional activities are generally well-accepted interventions which involve the use of therapeutic activity to enhance mobility, body mechanics, employability, coordination, and sensory motor integration.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nerve Gliding&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nerve gliding exercises are generally accepted and consist of a series of flexion and extension movements of the hand, wrist, elbow, shoulder, and neck that produce tension and longitudinal movement along the length of the median and other nerves of the upper extremity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neuromuscular Re-education&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Neuromuscular re-education is an accepted treatment that involves the skilled application of exercise with manual, mechanical, or electrical facilitation to enhance strength, movement patterns, neuromuscular response, proprioception, kinesthetic sense, coordination education of movement, balance, and posture. Indications include the need to promote neuromuscular responses through carefully timed proprioceptive stimuli, to elicit and improve motor activity in patterns similar to normal neurologically developed sequences, and improve neuromotor response with independent control.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Proper Work Techniques&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please refer to Section E.6.c., &quot;Jobsite Evaluations and Alterations,&quot; and Section H.4., &quot;Jobsite Alteration,&quot; in the original guideline document.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Therapeutic Exercise&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Therapeutic exercise is generally well-accepted and widely used. It is done with or without mechanical assistance or resistance may include isoinertial, isotonic, isometric, and isokinetic types of exercises. Indications include the need for cardiovascular fitness, reduced edema, improved muscle strength, improved connective tissue strength and integrity, increased bone density, promotion of circulation to enhance soft tissue healing, improvement of muscle recruitment, increased range of motion, and are used to promote normal movement patterns. Can also include complementary/alternative exercise such as movement therapy (with oversight of a physician or other appropriate healthcare professional).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapy&amp;ndash;Passive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most of the following passive therapies and modalities are generally well-accepted methods of care for a variety of work-related injuries. This includes those treatment modalities that do not require energy expenditure on the part of the patient. They are principally effective during the early phases of treatment and are directed at controlling symptoms such as pain, inflammation, swelling, and to improve the rate of healing soft tissue injuries. They should be used in adjunct with active therapies to help control swelling, pain and inflammation during the rehabilitation process. They may be used intermittently as a therapist deems appropriate or regularly if there are specific goals with objectively measured functional improvements during treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The following passive therapies and modalities are listed in alphabetical order. Please see the original guideline document for additional information, including indications for each therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Electrical stimulation (unattended) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Iontophoresis &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Low level laser therapy &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Manipulation &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Manual therapy techniques &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Massage (manual or mechanical) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Orthotics/immobilization with splinting and bracing &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Paraffin bath &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Superficial heat and cold therapy &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Ultrasound (including phonophoresis) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Restriction of Activities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Continuation of normal daily activities is an accepted and well-established recommendation for CTCs with or without neurologic symptoms. Complete work cessation should be avoided if possible, since it often further aggravates the pain presentation. Modified return-to-work is almost always more efficacious and rarely contraindicated in the vast majority of injured workers with CTCs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vocational Rehabilitation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A generally accepted intervention, but Colorado limits its use as a result of Senate Bill 87-79. Initiation of vocational rehabilitation requires adequate evaluation of patients for quantification of highest functional level, motivation, and achievement of maximum medical improvement (MMI). Vocational rehabilitation may be as simple as returning to the original job or as complicated as being retrained for a new occupation. The effectiveness of vocational rehabilitation may be enhanced when performed in combination with work hardening and work conditioning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It may also be beneficial for full vocational rehabilitation to be started before MMI if it is evident that the injured worker will be unable to return to his/her previous occupation. A positive goal and direction may aid the patient in decreasing stress and depression, and promote optimum rehabilitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="138" OrdBy="515" ID="423" Name="Clinical Algorithm(s)" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Algorithmic steps for causation assessment are provided in the original guideline document.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field></Section><Section SecID="424" OrdBy="600" Name="Evidence Supporting the Recommendations"><Field FieldID="139" OrdBy="610" ID="426" Name="Type of Evidence Supporting the Recommendations" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The type of evidence supporting the recommendations is not specifically stated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Only randomized controlled trials or meta-analyses were used for evidence statements regarding treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field></Section><Section SecID="427" OrdBy="700" Name="Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations"><Field FieldID="152" OrdBy="705" ID="428" Name="Potential Benefits" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Optimal medical and functional outcomes for injured workers with cumulative trauma conditions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="153" OrdBy="710" ID="429" Name="Potential Harms" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Injuries, side effects, or infections from therapeutic injections &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Side effects and drug interactions from medications &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Injury from device or component failure &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See specific sections of the original guideline document for detailed descriptions of potential harms.&lt;/p&gt;" /></Field></Section><Section SecID="430" OrdBy="800" Name="Contraindications"><Field FieldID="144" OrdBy="805" ID="431" Name="Contraindications" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;General contraindications to therapeutic injections include local or systemic infection, bleeding disorders, allergy to medications used, and patient refusal.

Therefore, these guidelines are not relevant as evidence of a provider's legal standard of professional care. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The Division provides procedures to implement medical treatment guidelines and to foster communication to resolve disputes among the provider, payer and patient through the Worker's Compensation Rules of Procedure.

The Division provides procedures to implement medical treatment guidelines and to foster communication to resolve disputes among the provider, payer and patient through the Worker's Compensation Rules of Procedure. In lieu of more costly litigation, parties may wish to seek administrative dispute resolution services through the Division or the office of administrative courts. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education&lt;/strong&gt;. Education of the patient and family, as well as the employer, insurer, policy makers and the community should be the primary emphasis in the treatment of cumulative trauma conditions (CTC) and disabilities. Currently, practitioners often think of education last, after medications, manual therapy, and surgery. Practitioners must develop and implement an effective strategy and skills to educate patients, employers, insurance systems, policy makers and the community as a whole. An education based paradigm should always start with inexpensive communication providing reassuring information to the patient. More in-depth education currently exists within a treatment regime employing functional restorative and innovative programs of prevention and rehabilitation. No treatment plan is complete without addressing issues of individual and/or group patient education as a means of facilitating self-management of symptoms and prevention. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treatment Parameter Duration&lt;/strong&gt;. Time frames for specific interventions commence once treatments have been initiated, not on the date of injury. Obviously, duration will be impacted by patient compliance, as well as availability of services. Clinical judgment may substantiate the need to accelerate or decelerate the time frames discussed in this document. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Active Interventions&lt;/strong&gt;. Emphasizing patient responsibility, such as therapeutic exercise and/or functional treatment, are generally emphasized over passive modalities, especially as treatment progresses. Generally, passive interventions are viewed as a means to facilitate progress in an active rehabilitation program with concomitant attainment of objective functional gains. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Active Therapeutic Exercise Program&lt;/strong&gt;. Goals should incorporate patient strength, endurance, flexibility, coordination, and education. This includes functional application in vocational or community settings. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Positive Patient Response&lt;/strong&gt;. Results are defined primarily as functional gains that can be objectively measured. Objective functional gains include, but are not limited to, positional tolerances, range-of-motion (ROM), strength and endurance, activities of daily living, cognition, psychological behavior, and efficiency/velocity measures that can be quantified. Subjective reports of pain and function should be considered and given relative weight when the pain has anatomic and physiologic correlation. Anatomic correlation must be based on objective findings. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Re-evaluate Treatment Every 3 to 4 Weeks&lt;/strong&gt;. If a given treatment or modality is not producing positive results within 3 to 4 weeks, the treatment should be either modified or discontinued. Reconsideration of diagnosis should also occur in the event of poor response to a seemingly rational intervention. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surgical Interventions&lt;/strong&gt;. Surgery should be contemplated within the context of expected functional outcome and not purely for the purpose of pain relief. The concept of &quot;cure&quot; with respect to surgical treatment by itself is generally a misnomer. All operative interventions must be based upon positive correlation of clinical findings, clinical course, and diagnostic tests. A comprehensive assimilation of these factors must lead to a specific diagnosis with positive identification of pathologic condition(s). &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Six-Month Time Frame&lt;/strong&gt;. The prognosis drops precipitously for returning an injured worker to work once he/she has been temporarily totally disabled for more than six months. The emphasis within these guidelines is to move patients along a continuum of care and return to work within a six-month time frame, whenever possible. It is important to note that time frames may not be pertinent to injuries that do not involve work-time loss or are not occupationally related. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Return-to-Work&lt;/strong&gt;. Return-to-work is therapeutic, assuming the work is not likely to aggravate the basic problem or increase long-term pain. The practitioner must provide specific physical limitations and the patient should never be released to &quot;sedentary&quot; or &quot;light duty.&quot; The following physical limitations should be considered and modified as recommended: lifting, pushing, pulling, crouching, walking, using stairs, bending at the waist, awkward and/or sustained postures, tolerance for sitting or standing, hot and cold environments, data entry and other repetitive motion tasks, sustained grip, tool usage and vibration factors. Even if there is residual chronic pain, return-to-work is not necessarily contraindicated.&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;p&gt;The practitioner should understand all of the physical demands of the patient's job position before returning the patient to full duty and should request clarification of the patient's job duties. Clarification should be obtained from the employer or if necessary, including, but not limited to a health care professional with experience in ergonomics, vocational rehabilitation specialist, or an industrial hygienist.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delayed Recovery&lt;/strong&gt;. Strongly consider a psychological evaluation, if not previously provided, as well as initiating interdisciplinary rehabilitation treatment and vocational goal setting, for those patients who are failing to make expected progress 6 to 12 weeks after an injury. The Division recognizes that 3% to 10% of all industrially injured patients will not recover within the timelines outlined in this document despite optimal care. Such individuals may require treatments beyond the limits discussed within this document, but such treatment will require clear documentation by the authorized treating practitioner focusing on objective functional gains afforded by further treatment and impact upon prognosis. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guideline Recommendations and Inclusion of Medical Evidence&lt;/strong&gt;. Guidelines are recommendations based on available evidence and/or consensus recommendations. When possible, guideline recommendations will note the level of evidence supporting the treatment recommendation. When interpreting medical evidence statements in the guideline, the following apply:&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;p&gt;Consensus means the opinion of experienced professionals based on general medical principles. Consensus recommendations are designated in the guideline as &quot;generally well accepted,&quot; &quot;generally accepted,&quot; &quot;acceptable/accepted,&quot; or &quot;well-established.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;p&gt;&quot;Some&quot; means the recommendation considered at least one adequate scientific study, which reported that a treatment was effective.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;p&gt;&quot;Good&quot; means the recommendation considered the availability of multiple adequate scientific studies or at least one relevant high-quality scientific study, which reported that a treatment was effective.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;p&gt;&quot;Strong&quot; means the recommendation considered the availability of multiple relevant and high quality scientific studies, which arrived at similar conclusions about the effectiveness of a treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;p&gt;All recommendations in these guidelines are considered to represent reasonable care in appropriately selected cases, regardless of the level of evidence or consensus statement attached to it. Those procedures considered inappropriate, unreasonable, or unnecessary are designated in the guideline as being &quot;not recommended.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Care beyond Maximum Medical Improvement (MMI)&lt;/strong&gt;. MMI should be declared when a patient's condition has plateaued to the point where the authorized treating physician no longer believes further medical intervention is likely to result in improved function. However, some patients may require treatment after MMI has been declared in order to maintain their functional state.
