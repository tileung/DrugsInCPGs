The ERG report for technology appraisal 234 and a subsequent rapid review report &lt;em&gt;Abatacept for treating rheumatoid arthritis after the failure of conventional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (rapid review of technology appraisal guidance 234)&lt;/em&gt; were prepared by the School of Health and Related Research (ScHARR) (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Clinical Effectiveness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critique of the Methods Used by the Manufacturer to Systematically Review Clinical Effectiveness Evidence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective of Systematic Review, and Description and Critique of Manufacturer's Search Strategy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The manufacturer's submission includes a systematic review of evidence for the clinical effectiveness of abatacept compared with either infliximab or placebo in adults with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have had an inadequate response to one or more conventional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) including methotrexate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Searches to identify all relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were conducted in January 2010 and updated in October 2010. The search strategy utilised terms to identify the condition (RA), the intervention (abatacept), and the type of evidence (RCTs); it was said to be closely modelled on the search strategy used by Chen et al., and, whilst inelegant in places, appears to be largely appropriate. However, it included a term limiting findings to studies published in the English language, and no justification for this restriction is provided in the manufacturer's submission.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Three electronic bibliographic databases were searched: Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. Because research registers such as the National Research Register, Clinical Trials Register, and metaRegister of Controlled Trials were not searched, key data may have been missed, particularly in relation to unpublished data and ongoing trials. Other key databases which were overlooked include the Science Citation Index (Web of Science), BIOSIS, and the Conference Proceedings Index; however, two conference websites, those of the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and the American College of Rheumatology (ACR), were searched for the years 2008 to 2010, and poster publications and unpublished manuscripts were provided by Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Supplementary searches such as citation searching of key papers and scanning of bibliographies of retrieved items were not reported. Nevertheless, the searches were adequate to retrieve important citations relating to all eligible studies of which the ERG and its clinical advisors are aware and, given the nature of the product and the stage of development, it is considered unlikely that the additional sources would have yielded any significant additional data.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The flow diagram relating to the clinical effectiveness literature searches is described as a QUOROM flow diagram. In fact, it more closely resembles the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement flow diagram (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.prisma-statement.org/statement.htm&quot; title=&quot;PRISMA Web site&quot;&gt;http://www.prisma-statement.org/statement.htm&lt;/a&gt;) which replaced the QUOROM diagram in 2009. The flow diagram appears to be an adequate representation of the study selection process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Statement of the Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria Used in the Study Selection, and Whether They Were Appropriate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Details of the inclusion and exclusion criteria used in the selection of evidence for the systematic review of clinical effectiveness, as specified in the manufacturer's submission, are summarised&amp;nbsp;in the table below. In the manufacturer's submission, this table was labelled 'eligibility criteria used in search strategy': however, it was presented within the description of the study selection process and clearly relates to the inclusion and exclusion criteria used at that stage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With the exception of the exclusion of non-English language studies, which is not justified, the specified inclusion and exclusion criteria are appropriate and reflect the information given in the decision problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Table.

However, the manufacturer's Medline search strategy was rerun: it failed to identify one of the major publications from the AIM study, and may therefore also have missed other relevant publications. Moreover, it is not clear whether any relevant studies were excluded by the restriction of the searches to English language papers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The ERG team also searched ClinicalTrials.gov (&lt;a href=&quot;http://clinicaltrials.gov&quot; title=&quot;Clinicaltrials.gov Web site&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://clinicaltrials.gov&lt;/a&gt;), and identified one additional relevant study which was said to have available results.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Two relevant articles relating to studies identified by the manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s systematic review were not referenced in the manufacturer's submission.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The manufacturer's systematic review of clinical effectiveness was limited to studies which compared abatacept with either infliximab or placebo. It is implied, but not stated, that no studies were identified which compared abatacept directly with adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, or golimumab.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See Section 4 of the original ERG report for additional details regarding the manufacturer's search strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Cost-Effectiveness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The manufacturer provided a systematic review of previous economic evaluation of biologic and conventional DMARDs. Whilst useful in providing background information and an indication of the likely cost-effectiveness of abatacept, none of these studies adequately addressed the decision problem and the focus of the cost-effectiveness sections of the original ERG report is the &lt;em&gt;de novo&lt;/em&gt; model submitted by the manufacturer. A brief summary is provided of two studies that explicitly incorporated abatacept although both have limitations.

The ERG report for technology appraisal 234 and a subsequent rapid review report &lt;em&gt;Abatacept for treating rheumatoid arthritis after the failure of conventional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (rapid review of technology appraisal guidance 234)&lt;/em&gt; were prepared by the School of Health and Related Research (ScHARR) (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Clinical Effectiveness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description and Critique of the Manufacturer's Approach to Validity Assessment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Table 6 of the original ERG report (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) provides quality assessment of included trials. See Section 4.1.5 of the ERG report for additional detail on validity assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description and Critique of the Statistical Approach Used Within Each Relevant Trial&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The statistical analyses used in the randomised controlled trials included in the clinical effectiveness section are summarised in Table 8 in the ERG report. They are generally acceptable. However, it should be noted that, in the Kremer Phase 2b study, the objective is based on response rates at 6 months, whereas the main analysis with adjustment for multiple comparisons is based on response rates at 12 month. In the ATTEST study, the alternative hypothesis does not specify the size of the treatment effect which the study was designed to detect. Furthermore, the statement that &quot;the &amp;chi;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; test was performed to evaluate the differences (and 95% confidence intervals) between the abatacept or infliximab groups and placebo&quot; should specify the variables. The absence of information relating to the power calculation used in study IM101-119 is unfortunate, particularly as the results suggest that it may have been underpowered in relation to all outcomes, including its primary outcome (see Section 4.2.1 of the original ERG report).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subgroup Analyses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The manufacturer's submission states that, in the AIM trial, subgroup analyses were performed by age, gender, race, geographic region, duration of rheumatoid arthritis, swollen joint count (SJC), tender joint count (TJC), C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, weight, Genant-Modified Sharp (GMS) total score, Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI), and ACR responses at Day 169, wherever applicable, while in the ATTEST trial, subgroup analyses were performed by age, gender, race, geographic region, duration of rheumatoid arthritis, SJC, TJC, CRP levels and rheumatoid factor (RF) status. These analyses were performed to comply with the ethical guidelines for clinical trials. No statistical testing was performed for these subgroups because they were not powered to detect any differences between the treatment groups, but the analyses were held to demonstrate the consistency and robustness of efficacy results across different subpopulations and compared to the entire study population. Further clarification obtained from the manufacturer emphasised that subgroup analyses by baseline disease severity and level of inflammation were performed to check the robustness of the studies, and whether the overall study results were driven by a specific subgroup of patients with greater disease severity at baseline. The results of such analyses were not presented in the manufacturer's submission.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No subgroup analyses were performed in the Kremer Phase 2b trial.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Refer to Section 4.1.7 of the original ERG report for a description and critique of the manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s approach to outcome selection within each relevant trial and to Section 4.1.8 for a discussion of the extent to which each relevant trial includes the patient population(s), intervention(s), comparator(s) and outcomes as defined in the final scope.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Cost-Effectiveness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Cost-Effectiveness Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summary and Critique of Manufacturer's Submitted Economic Evaluation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The manufacturer supplied a simulation model written within Microsoft Excel. The model was relatively more complex that most seen by the ERG due to the incorporation of user-defined functions and a large number of defined names. The omission of a glossary of names and description of the functions increased the time required to review and validate the model. It is unclear whether the structure of the model contributed to a serious error that was identified by the ERG that is detailed in the ERG report.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The illustration of the model that was submitted by the manufacturer has been replicated in Figure 1 of the ERG report. Further explanation (written by the ERG) has been provided after this figure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The model attempted to incorporate both individual patient level uncertainty where the starting characteristics (such as age, weight, and HAQ score) and response to treatment and whether a patient suffers an adverse event are simulated for each patient, as well as the parameter uncertainty for values such as the rate of serious adverse events or change in baseline HAQ for an intervention. Exploratory analyses were undertaken by the manufacturer to determine the level of individual patients (8,000) required to achieve a stable answer. Due to the computational time necessary to undertake probabilistic sensitivity analyses, the number of patients in each run was reduced to 1,000 with the manufacturer assuming that 500 sets of parameter values were required to produce stable answers. The ERG comment that there was some variability in results using the same parameter inputs when the patient numbers were reduced to 1,000 but note that the standard deviation between 10 runs of 1,000 patients was never more than 1% of the mean value and thus the reduction in the number of individual patients simulated would not overly effect the results. However, as is detailed in the ERG report, there was a serious error in the actual implementation of the parameter uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See Section 5 of the original ERG report for additional information on the cost-effectiveness analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Additional Work Undertaken by the ERG&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The ERG amended some of the identified errors, and undertook five analyses (objective, optimistic, favourable, pessimistic, and hybrid) in order to provide the appraisal committee with additional information to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of abatacept in rheumatoid arthritis after the failure of conventional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See Section 6 of the original ERG report for additional information on work undertaken by the ERG.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated Cost-Effectiveness Analysis in the Rapid Review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Rapid Review report contains a critique of a rapid review of abatacept for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis after the failure of conventional DMARDS initiated by Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd following the agreement of a patient access scheme (PAS) with the Department of Health. The PAS is a simple discount that will be applied to the current National Health Service (NHS) list price of abatacept.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The manufacturer submitted new evidence to support a claim for cost-effectiveness following the PAS, and the Rapid Review report provides a critique of the evidenced contained therein.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The manufacturer made three changes to the model previously submitted. These were:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Changing the cost of abatacept to reflect the PAS &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Removing the vial wastage assumption for infliximab &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Removing the assumption of dose escalation for etanercept, adalimumab and infliximab &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="112" OrdBy="440" ID="413" Name="Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations" Type="picklist-choice"><FieldValue Value="Expert Consensus" /></Field><Field FieldID="145" OrdBy="445" ID="414" Name="Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Considerations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Technology appraisal recommendations are based on a review of clinical and economic evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technology Appraisal Process&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invites 'consultee' and 'commentator' organisations to take part in the appraisal process. Consultee organisations include national groups representing patients and carers, the bodies representing health professionals, and the manufacturers of the technology under review. Consultees are invited to submit evidence during the appraisal and to comment on the appraisal documents.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Commentator organisations include manufacturers of the products with which the technology is being compared, the National Health Service (NHS) Quality Improvement Scotland and research groups working in the area. They can comment on the evidence and other documents but are not asked to submit evidence themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;NICE then commissions an independent academic centre to review published evidence on the technology and prepare an 'assessment report'. Consultees and commentators are invited to comment on the report. The assessment report and the comments on it are then drawn together in a document called the evaluation report.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An independent Appraisal Committee then considers the evaluation report. It holds a meeting where it hears direct, spoken evidence from nominated clinical experts, patients and carers. The Committee uses all the evidence to make its first recommendations, in a document called the 'appraisal consultation document' (ACD). NICE sends all the consultees and commentators a copy of this document and posts it on the NICE Web site. Further comments are invited from everyone taking part.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the Committee meets again it considers any comments submitted on the ACD; then it prepares its final recommendations in a document called the 'final appraisal determination' (FAD). This is submitted to NICE for approval.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Consultees have a chance to appeal against the final recommendations in the FAD. If there are no appeals, the final recommendations become the basis of the guidance that NICE issues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who Is on the Appraisal Committee?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;NICE technology appraisal recommendations are prepared by an independent committee. This includes health professionals working in the NHS and people who are familiar with the issues affecting patients, and carers. Although the Appraisal Committee seeks the views of organisations representing health professionals, patients, carers, manufacturers and government, its advice is independent of any vested interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="146" OrdBy="450" ID="415" Name="Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not applicable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="148" OrdBy="460" ID="417" Name="Cost Analysis" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Summary of Appraisal Committee's Key Conclusions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Availability and Nature of Evidence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After publication of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) technology appraisal guidance 234, the manufacturer submitted a patient access scheme for abatacept for the Committee to consider in a rapid review of the original guidance, which used the economic model from NICE technology appraisal guidance 234.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uncertainties Around and Plausibility of Assumptions and Inputs in the Economic Model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Committee had discussed the manufacturer's model in NICE technology appraisal guidance 234 and had concerns around a number of assumptions in the model.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Committee recognised that 2 of these uncertainties (Health Assessment Questionnaire [HAQ] score on disease progression and exclusion of productivity costs) had been addressed by the Evidence Review Group (ERG) as part of their exploratory analysis based on the manufacturer's rapid review submission.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, the Committee accepted that the other uncertainties remained but could not be addressed in the time frame of a rapid review.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incorporation of Health-Related Quality-of-Life Benefits and Utility Values.
