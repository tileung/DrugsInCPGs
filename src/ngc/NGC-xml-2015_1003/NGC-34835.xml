See the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field for the full version of this guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The evidence reviews used to develop the guideline recommendations were underpinned by systematic literature searches, following the methods described in &quot;The guidelines manual&quot; (2009) (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The search strategies for the key clinical questions were developed by the Information Services Team with advice from the Short Clinical Guidelines Technical Team (see the &quot;Description of Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence&quot; field for the list of questions). Structured clinical questions were developed using the PICO (population, intervention, comparison, outcome) model and were translated into search strategies using subject heading and free text terms. The strategies were run across a number of databases with no date restrictions imposed on the searches.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To identify economic evaluations the NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED) and the Health Economic Evaluations Database (HEED) were searched. Search filters to identify economic evaluations and quality of life studies were used to interrogate bibliographic databases. There were no date restrictions imposed on the searches.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the systematic literature searches, the Guideline Development Group members were asked to alert the Short Clinical Guidelines Technical Team to any additional evidence, published, unpublished or in press, that met the inclusion criteria. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The searches were undertaken between January to March 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scoping Searches&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Scoping searches were undertaken in October 2009 using the following websites and databases (listed in alphabetical order); browsing or simple search strategies were employed. The search results were used to provide information for scope development and project planning.

See the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field for the full version of this guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The guideline addresses six key clinical questions:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;What elements should be included in an allergy-focused clinical history? &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;What tests should be used to diagnose immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated allergy? &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;What tests should be used to diagnose non-IgE-mediated food allergy? &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;What information should be provided during the diagnostic process? &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;When should referrals to secondary and/or specialist care be made? &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;What is the value of alternative diagnostic tests? &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Wherever possible, grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation (GRADE) was used as a method to assess study quality. However, where GRADE tables were not appropriate, quality assessments were based on critical appraisal of the study design and limitations. GRADE is currently only developed for intervention studies and therefore was not appropriate for clinical questions one, four and five, which addressed clinical history taking, the information needs of the child or young person and referral to secondary or specialist care, respectively. Where GRADE was not used, its principles (indirectness, limitations, inconsistency, imprecision and other considerations) formed part of the discussion of the evidence with the Guideline Development Group (GDG). In question one the GDG did not identify any studies that compared clinical history taking with no clinical history taking. So studies in which clinical history had been taken were evaluated to identify the relevant questions for an allergy-focused clinical history. A review of reviews was done to analyse the risk factors that would be associated with likely development of food allergy. For question four most of the papers identified were qualitative papers, for which it is inappropriate to use a modified GRADE assessment. For question five no studies were identified comparing cohorts of children who had been referred with those who had not. For a full explanation of how this type of guideline is developed, see 'The guidelines manual' (2009) (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost Effectiveness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A decision tree was used to model the diagnosis of food allergy in children and a subsequent Markov model was constructed to explore the long-term outcomes (see the &quot;Cost Analysis&quot; field). The model structure is outlined in Figure 1 of Appendix 3 of the full version of the original guideline document.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="112" OrdBy="440" ID="413" Name="Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations" Type="picklist-choice"><FieldValue Value="Expert Consensus" /></Field><Field FieldID="145" OrdBy="445" ID="414" Name="Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)&lt;/strong&gt;: This guideline was developed by the Centre for Clinical Practice at the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE).

Each GDG has a Chair, healthcare professional members and a minimum of two patient and carer members. Co-opted expert advisers are recruited, as appropriate. A Clinical Adviser, who has specific content expertise and additional responsibilities, may also be appointed depending on the topic. Recruitment of the GDG Chair and members is carried out in accordance with NICE's policy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The GDG makes its decisions using the best available evidence presented to it at GDG meetings by the Short Clinical Guidelines Team. The use of formal consensus methods within the GDG will be considered on a case-by-case basis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developing Review Questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A short clinical guideline has a narrow scope and covers only part of a care pathway. It addresses a maximum of three subject areas covering clinical management. This will result in a small number of key clinical issues. These are broken down into a defined number of review questions &amp;mdash; usually one or two per clinical management area. The exact number will be dictated by the size of the short clinical guideline remit and the amount of development time available.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creating Guideline Recommendations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Explicit methods of linking the evidence to recommendations are used for short clinical guidelines if the topic is suitable. This involves using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Research recommendations are formulated for short clinical guidelines. Their number is dependent on the size of the short clinical guideline remit and the amount of development time available.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Writing the Guideline&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are usually three versions of short clinical guidelines:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The full guideline &amp;ndash; all the recommendations, details of how they were developed and summaries of the evidence they are based on. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The quick reference guide &amp;ndash; a summary of the recommendations for healthcare professionals. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Understanding NICE guidance' &amp;ndash; a summary for patients and carers. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The full guideline is written by the Short Clinical Guidelines Team, following the principles in chapters 9 and 10 of 'The guidelines manual' (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="146" OrdBy="450" ID="415" Name="Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not applicable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="148" OrdBy="460" ID="417" Name="Cost Analysis" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results from this analysis appear to suggest that skin prick and immunoglobulin E (IgE) blood testing to confirm a diagnosis of food allergy in children is associated with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) below a threshold of &amp;pound;20,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. The difference in quality of life between those with allergies and those without appears to be the main driver behind the cost effectiveness. Sensitivity analyses indicate that this decision is robust with very high probabilities of being cost effective. The skin prick test appears to be the most cost effective option; however this is likely to depend on the number of people tested per year to make sure that wastage does not occur.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The analysis is very simplistic in terms of the model structure and the data inputted into the model. Therefore, these results should be approached with caution. The full impact of allergies on individuals and the health service are not captured fully by the analysis. Nutritional well being of the child and the impact of repeat appointments from concerned parents are not comprehensively captured by the analysis. It is unclear in which way these factors would affect the cost effectiveness estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The results presented should be considered exploratory given the significant issues in the quality of data and assumptions made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="104" OrdBy="465" ID="418" Name="Method of Guideline Validation" Type="picklist-choice"><FieldValue Value="External Peer Review" /><FieldValue Value="Internal Peer Review" /></Field><Field FieldID="130" OrdBy="470" ID="419" Name="Description of Method of Guideline Validation" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guideline was validated through two consultations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The first draft of the guideline (the full guideline, National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence [NICE] guideline, and Quick Reference Guide) were consulted with Stakeholders and comments were considered by the Guideline Development Group (GDG) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The final consultation draft of the Full guideline, the NICE guideline and the Information for the Public were submitted to stakeholders for final comments. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The final draft was submitted to the Guideline Review Panel for review prior to publication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field></Section><Section SecID="420" OrdBy="500" Name="Recommendations"><Field FieldID="151" OrdBy="505" ID="421" Name="Major Recommendations" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)&lt;/strong&gt;: This guideline was developed by the Centre for Clinical Practice at the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE).
