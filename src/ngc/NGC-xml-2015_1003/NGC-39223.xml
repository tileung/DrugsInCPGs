Only a court can declare an adult patient incompetent. In most situations, however, clinicians can assess patients' decision-making capacity and act on these assessments without involvement of the courts. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Ethically and legally, there are no differences between refusing cardiovascular implantable electronic device (CIED) therapy and requesting withdrawal of CIED therapy. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Advance directives should be encouraged for all patients with CIEDs. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Legally, carrying out a request to withdraw life-sustaining treatment is neither physician-assisted suicide nor euthanasia. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Ethically, CIED deactivation is neither physician-assisted suicide nor euthanasia. When carrying out a patient's request for withdrawal of a life-sustaining treatment that a patient perceives as unwanted (including CIED therapies), the clinician's intent is to discontinue the unwanted treatment and allow the patient to die naturally of the underlying disease - not to terminate the patient's life. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The right to refuse or request the withdrawal of a treatment is a personal right of the patient and does not depend on the characteristics of the particular treatment involved (i.e., CIEDs). Therefore, no treatment, including CIED therapies, has unique ethical or legal status. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;A clinician cannot be compelled to carry out an ethically- and legally-permissible procedure (i.e., CIED deactivation) that s/he personally views in conflict with his/her personal values. In these circumstances, the clinician cannot abandon the patient but should involve a colleague who is willing to carry out the procedure. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Basic Religious Principles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Legal and ethical rationales for respecting patients' rights to refuse medical treatment are supported by the tenets of major religious traditions in Western culture. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Depending on the significance (to the patient) of religious belief and its bearing on the decision to be made, it can be part of what motivates a patient to choose or refuse deactivation of CIED devices. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The distinction between letting life go (allowing to die) and taking life (intending to actively kill) is religiously important, especially for those who appeal to it as part of their religious understanding of justifiable choices regarding death. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Perception of disproportionate burden caused by continuation of life-sustaining treatment, as determined by the patient, is central to religious justifications of permissibility of letting life go. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;A clinician whose own religious beliefs are not in line with the patient's may not override a patient's or surrogate's choice. The clinician may, however, appeal to his/her own right not to participate in deactivation&amp;mdash;not abandoning the patient but by involving a colleague who is willing to carry out the procedure. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Patients should be provided the support they want and need in order to make decisions about deactivation of CIEDs that are coherent with their spiritual and moral beliefs. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Effectively Putting into Practice the Device Deactivation Process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communication&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Communication about CIEDs should be a part of a larger conversation about patients' goals of care. The role of the clinician is to help patients determine how the benefits and burdens of device therapy align with their desired outcomes for their health care. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Communication about CIED deactivation is an ongoing process that starts prior to implant and continues over time as patient's health status changes. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;While the role of the clinician is to advise and assist the patient and family, the ultimate decision-making authority rests with the patient; or his/her surrogate, if the patient does not have capacity to make the decision. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Multiple options are available to the patient, family, and clinicians with regard to the extent of deactivation of CIED therapy and the modalities available, ranging from programming off only certain features such as shock therapy, to discontinuation of all therapy to not replacing a depleting device. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logistics of CIED Deactivation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Any physician or center that implants CIEDs should have a clearly defined process to withdraw therapies at such a time that becomes appropriate. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Deactivation of CIED therapies requires an order from the responsible physician, preferably written, with appropriate documentation. In emergent situations, a verbal order should be followed by written documentation within 24 hours. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Documentation prior to deactivation must include the physician's determination that the patient has the capacity to make the decision or that the appropriate surrogate has been identified; that consequences to deactivation have been discussed; and that alternatives have been discussed if relevant. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;A physician order for deactivation must include the specific therapies to be deactivated or re-programmed. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The deactivation process should include anticipation of symptoms and appropriate palliative care planning tailored to individual patients' needs, as well as the needs of family members when appropriate. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Deactivation of anti-tachycardia therapies may be achieved by re-programming or by magnet application. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Deactivation of pacing therapies may be achieved by reprogramming to specific modes or to sub-threshold outputs. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Any uncertainties about the specifics of deactivation should be clarified by the health care team, ideally in consultation with a physician with electrophysiology expertise. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The specific resources of acute care facilities, inpatient hospice, long-term care facilities, or patients at home require careful consideration when planning and carrying out a device deactivation. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;All Industry Employed Allied Professionals (IEAP) must work under direct supervision of medical personnel (except in highly rare circumstances). &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Each manufacturer has policies that apply to the deactivation of CIED therapies; it is the responsibility of the IEAP to ensure that they adhere to these policies. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Personnel including clinicians and IEAPs who do not wish to personally participate in deactivation should assist in locating qualified individuals who are willing to carry out this request. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Special Populations&amp;mdash;Pediatrics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Management of CIEDs in children nearing end of life or requesting withdrawal of treatment requires an assessment of the child's decision-making capacity. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;If a child does not have decision-making capacity, a parent or guardian should make decisions in the child's best interest. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Even when a child does not have decision-making capacity, communication of decisions should be provided to the child, recognizing their developmental level and individual preferences. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="138" OrdBy="515" ID="423" Name="Clinical Algorithm(s)" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;None provided&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field></Section><Section SecID="424" OrdBy="600" Name="Evidence Supporting the Recommendations"><Field FieldID="139" OrdBy="610" ID="426" Name="Type of Evidence Supporting the Recommendations" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The type of evidence supporting each recommendation is not specifically stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field></Section><Section SecID="427" OrdBy="700" Name="Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations"><Field FieldID="152" OrdBy="705" ID="428" Name="Potential Benefits" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Improved evaluation, communication and management (including device deactivation) of patients with cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) nearing end of life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="153" OrdBy="710" ID="429" Name="Potential Harms" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not stated&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field></Section><Section SecID="432" OrdBy="900" Name="Qualifying Statements"><Field FieldID="137" OrdBy="905" ID="433" Name="Qualifying Statements" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;When using or considering the guidance given in this document, it is important to remember that there are no absolutes with regard to many clinical situations.
