Full paper manuscripts of any titles/abstracts that were considered relevant by either reviewer were obtained where possible. The relevance of each study was assessed according to the criteria set out below. Studies that did not meet the criteria were excluded and their bibliographic details listed alongside reasons for exclusion. These are listed in Appendix 5 of the assessment report. Any discrepancies were resolved by consensus and where necessary a third reviewer was consulted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Study Design&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included in the assessment of clinical effectiveness. Full economic evaluations (EEs) were included in the assessment of cost effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Assessment Group (AG) also identified and assessed the quality of existing systematic reviews (SRs) in order to cross check for the identification of additional studies as well as to gain an understanding of the issues related to the combining of data in this complex area. A summary and critique of relevant SRs is presented in Appendix 3 of the assessment report.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interventions and Comparators&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The effectiveness of two antiplatelet agents, used within their licensed indications was assessed: (i) clopidogrel alone and (ii) MRD alone or in combination with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). Studies that compared clopidogrel alone, or MRD (alone or in combination with ASA) with ASA or, where appropriate, with each other, were included in the review. Trials in which clopidogrel was used as an adjunct to percutaneous coronary intervention were excluded from the review. Trials in which clopidogrel was combined with ASA were also excluded as they were not within the remit of the scope.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Patient Populations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For clopidogrel, patients with a history of myocardial infarction (MI) or ischaemic stroke (IS) or established peripheral arterial disease (PAD) were included. Patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) were not included, neither were those with atrial fibrillation. For MRD, patients with a history of IS or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) were included.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Outcomes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Data on any of the following outcomes were included in the assessment of clinical effectiveness: MI; stroke; TIA; death; adverse events (AEs) including bleeding complications. No data relating to health-related quality of life (HRQoL) or unstable angina were identified. For the assessment of cost effectiveness, outcomes included incremental cost per life years gained (LYG) and incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost-Effectiveness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review of Existing Cost-Effectiveness Studies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Full details of the search strategy and the methods for selecting evidence are presented above. Of 34 potentially relevant studies, eleven met the criteria for inclusion in the cost-effectiveness review; one study was also included in the systematic review that informed the previous guidance. Of the eleven included studies, seven were published in full while four were available only in abstract format. Most of the studies were of reasonable quality; however, more detail and focused critique of the clinical effectiveness evidence used to inform the economic evaluations would have improved the quality of the studies (see Appendix 2 of the assessment report).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="136" OrdBy="415" ID="408" Name="Number of Source Documents" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Effectiveness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Four randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included: 2 studies included in quantitative synthesis (6 publications) and 2 studies from existing TA90 Guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost-Effectiveness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Of 34 potentially relevant studies, eleven met the criteria for inclusion in the cost-effectiveness review. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Two economic models were submitted by the manufacturers. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;An independent economic model was presented by the Assessment Group. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="115" OrdBy="420" ID="409" Name="Methods Used to Assess the Quality and Strength of the Evidence" Type="picklist-choice"><FieldValue Value="Expert Consensus" /></Field><Field FieldID="149" OrdBy="425" ID="410" Name="Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not applicable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="116" OrdBy="430" ID="411" Name="Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence" Type="picklist-many"><FieldValue Value="Review of Published Meta-Analyses" /><FieldValue Value="Systematic Review with Evidence Tables" /></Field><Field FieldID="150" OrdBy="435" ID="412" Name="Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)&lt;/strong&gt;: The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) commissioned an independent academic centre to perform a systematic literature review on the technology considered in this appraisal and prepare an assessment report.

The two reviewers cross-checked each other's extraction and a third independent reviewer checked for accuracy and was consulted in cases of disagreement. Where multiple publications of the same study were identified, data were extracted and reported as a single study.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quality Assessment Strategy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The quality of clinical-effectiveness studies was assessed by two reviewers and checked by a third reviewer according to criteria based on National Health Service Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (NHS CRD) Report 4. The quality of the cost-effectiveness studies was assessed by two reviewers according to a checklist updated from that developed by Drummond et al. All relevant information is tabulated and summarised within the text of the report. Full details and results of the quality assessment strategy for clinical and cost-effectiveness studies are reported in Appendix 2 of the assessment report.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods of Data Synthesis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Direct Evidence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The results of clinical and economic data extraction and quality assessment are summarised in structured tables and as a narrative description. The decision problem of interest to this review was made up of the following comparisons: 1) clopidogrel versus acetylsalicylic acid (ASA); 2) clopidogrel versus modified-release dipyridamole (MRD) alone; 3) clopidogrel versus MRD+ASA; 4) MRD+ASA versus ASA and 5) MRD alone versus ASA.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Indirect Evidence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Due to the differences between trials in terms of interventions and comparators, indirect analysis (using a mixed treatment comparison [MTC] methodology) was performed on a variety of outcomes. The methods and results of the MTC are reported in Section 5.3 of the assessment report.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Additional Analysis by the Assessment Group (AG)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Using data provided by the manufacturers of clopidogrel, the AG undertook subgroup analysis and explored the clinical effectiveness of clopidogrel in patients with multivascular disease (MVD). The AG was also able to explore whether key outcome events are distributed evenly across the whole period of trial follow-up, or if there are particular time points when patients appear to be at greater risk.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Refer to Section 5 and Appendix 2 of the assessment report for more information.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost-Effectiveness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review of Existing Cost-Effectiveness Studies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most of the published studies were of reasonable quality; however, more detail and focused critique of the clinical effectiveness evidence used to inform the economic evaluations would have improved the quality of the studies (see Appendix 2 of the assessment report).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review of the Modified-release Dipyridamole (MRD) Manufacturer's Submission&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A Markov model was designed to assess the cost effectiveness of MRD+acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) vs ASA alone, clopidogrel and no treatment for the secondary prevention of occlusive vascular events (OVEs) in:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Patients who have experienced an ischaemic stroke (IS) and are tolerant of ASA &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Patients who have experienced a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) and are tolerant of ASA &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The model estimates costs from the perspective of the UK NHS, and health outcomes in terms of life years and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) in a simulated cohort of 1,000 patients initially aged 45 to 80 years using a time horizon of 2.5&amp;ndash;50 years and a cycle length of six months. The model is based on the model developed by the Technology Appraisal Group to inform the previous guidance. The structure of the manufacturer's model is shown in Figure 6-1 of the assessment report.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The model presents five health states:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;No recurrent stroke &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Recurrent IS &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Haemorrhagic stroke &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Vascular death &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Non-vascular death &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The results of base case and sensitivity analyses performed by the manufacturer, as well as the critique of the economic model by AG are presented in the assessment report.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review of the Clopidogrel Manufacturers' Submission&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A Markov model was designed to assess the cost effectiveness of clopidogrel, MRD+ASA, ASA and MRD alone for the secondary prevention of OVEs: MI, IS, and vascular death. Cost-effectiveness estimates are calculated for four different patient populations:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Patients who have previously suffered an MI &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Patients who have previously suffered an IS &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Patients who were diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Patients with MVD which is described as ischaemic disease in more than one vascular bed. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The same model structure is used throughout, but the baseline risks of vascular events differ for each population. The four treatments under consideration are only compared against each other in the IS population; while in MI, PAD and MVD populations only clopidogrel is compared with ASA.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The model employs six health states (see Figure 6-2 of the assessment report):&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Initial state: this is the starting condition for all patients, and is considered to be a 'stable' state &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Death: separately recorded for deaths of non-vascular and vascular origin &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;History of MI: the condition of patients following a non-fatal MI &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;History of stroke: the condition of patients following a non-fatal IS &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;History of MI and stroke: the condition of patients who have suffered both a non-fatal MI and a non-fatal stroke &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;TA80 state: this intermediate state relates to the TA80 guidance which recommends that treatment with clopidogrel+ASA should be continued for up to twelve months (four cycles in the model) after the most recent acute episode of non ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). In the model, after four cycles, patients go back to antiplatelet monotherapy. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The sensitivity analysis and critique of this model are presented in the assessment report.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Independent Economic Assessment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The AG has chosen to develop a new model of OVEs involving individual patient sampling. Instead of considering patients in aggregated groups with average characteristics, they generated a series of individual patients whose combined characteristics are representative of the specified population.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Patient Populations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Four mutually exclusive patient populations are modelled:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;MI only &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Stroke/TIA only &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;PAD only &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;MVD &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Model Design&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The logic flow for generating a full patient history for each sampled patient is shown in Figure 6-3 of the assessment report for the first two key events. Since event times are estimated as continuous variables, it is not possible for a conflict to arise with two events occurring simultaneously. Subsequent events repeat the same pattern. Each patient continues to accumulate additional events until a fatal event is encountered.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See Section 6 of the assessment report for additional information on economic evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="112" OrdBy="440" ID="413" Name="Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations" Type="picklist-choice"><FieldValue Value="Expert Consensus" /></Field><Field FieldID="145" OrdBy="445" ID="414" Name="Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Considerations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Technology appraisal recommendations are based on a review of clinical and economic evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technology Appraisal Process&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) invites 'consultee' and 'commentator' organisations to take part in the appraisal process. Consultee organisations include national groups representing patients and carers, the bodies representing health professionals, and the manufacturers of the technology under review. Consultees are invited to submit evidence during the appraisal and to comment on the appraisal documents.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Commentator organisations include manufacturers of the products with which the technology is being compared, the National Health Service (NHS) Quality Improvement Scotland and research groups working in the area. They can comment on the evidence and other documents but are not asked to submit evidence themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;NICE then commissions an independent academic centre to review published evidence on the technology and prepare an 'assessment report'. Consultees and commentators are invited to comment on the report. The assessment report and the comments on it are then drawn together in a document called the evaluation report.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An independent Appraisal Committee then considers the evaluation report. It holds a meeting where it hears direct, spoken evidence from nominated clinical experts, patients and carers. The Committee uses all the evidence to make its first recommendations, in a document called the 'appraisal consultation document' (ACD). NICE sends all the consultees and commentators a copy of this document and posts it on the NICE Web site. Further comments are invited from everyone taking part.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the Committee meets again it considers any comments submitted on the ACD; then it prepares its final recommendations in a document called the 'final appraisal determination' (FAD). This is submitted to NICE for approval.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Consultees have a chance to appeal against the final recommendations in the FAD. If there are no appeals, the final recommendations become the basis of the guidance that NICE issues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who Is on the Appraisal Committee?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;NICE technology appraisal recommendations are prepared by an independent committee. This includes health professionals working in the NHS and people who are familiar with the issues affecting patients and carers.

In people with a history of myocardial infarction, peripheral arterial disease or multivascular disease, clopidogrel was compared with aspirin.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The model of the manufacturers of modified-release dipyridamole estimated the cost-effectiveness of modified-release dipyridamole plus aspirin compared with aspirin, clopidogrel and no treatment. Separate analyses were conducted for people who had had an ischaemic stroke, and for people who had had a transient ischaemic attack. Only people tolerant to aspirin were considered in the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Assessment Group developed an individual patient sampling model, in which a series of individual profiles were generated whose combined characteristics were representative of the specified population. Analyses were split by population: ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction, peripheral arterial disease and multivascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary of the Appraisal Committee's Key Conclusions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the subgroup of people with peripheral arterial disease, a treatment strategy of clopidogrel followed by aspirin had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of around &amp;pound;2800 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained compared with aspirin alone. In people with intolerance to aspirin, treatment with clopidogrel had an ICER of around &amp;pound;720 per QALY gained compared with no preventive therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the subgroup of people with multivascular disease, a treatment strategy of clopidogrel followed by aspirin had an ICER of around &amp;pound;2600 per QALY gained compared with treatment with aspirin alone. In people with intolerance to aspirin, clopidogrel was a cost-saving strategy, costing less and producing more benefits than no preventive therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the subgroup of people who have had a myocardial infarction, the treatment strategy of aspirin followed by clopidogrel had an ICER of &amp;pound;2000 per QALY gained, compared with treatment with aspirin alone. In people with intolerance to aspirin, clopidogrel had an ICER of &amp;pound;2000 per QALY gained compared with no preventive therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For people who have had an ischaemic stroke, when the generic price of clopidogrel was used, the treatment strategy of clopidogrel followed by modified-release dipyridamole plus aspirin and then aspirin alone had an ICER of &amp;pound;13,600 per QALY gained compared with treatment with clopidogrel followed by aspirin, followed by modified-release dipyridamole plus aspirin. In people with intolerance to modified-release dipyridamole, the treatment strategy of clopidogrel followed by aspirin had an ICER of &amp;pound;4000 per QALY gained compared with aspirin alone. In people with intolerance to aspirin, the treatment strategy of clopidogrel followed by modified-release dipyridamole alone had an ICER of &amp;pound;7,100 per QALY gained, compared with treatment with clopidogrel alone. For people who had intolerance to clopidogrel and aspirin, treatment with modified-release dipyridamole alone had an ICER of &amp;pound;314 per QALY gained in comparison with no preventive therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For people who have had a transient ischaemic attack, treatment with modified-release dipyridamole plus aspirin had an ICER of &amp;pound;9,100 per QALY gained compared with treatment with aspirin alone.
