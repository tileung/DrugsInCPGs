Where similar or related recommendations on a particular topic appeared in more than two guidelines, it was added to the topic list. The final list of topics was then cross-referenced with the Stroke Canada Optimization of Rehabilitation through Evidence (SCORE) and the Canadian Stroke Quality of Care Study (CSQCS) studies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Best Practices Recommendations Matrix was created through an iterative process of review and discussion among the members of the sub-group and the Best Practices and Standards Working Group (BPS-WG) as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluation of Levels of Evidence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Each recommendation included in this document was evaluated against several criteria: strength of the available research evidence to support the recommendation; degree to which the recommendation drives system change or processes of care delivery; overall validity and relevance as a core recommendation for stroke care along the continuum of care. The levels of evidence included in this document are determined through a structured ranking system which measures the strength of the results in a clinical trial or research study. The design of the study (such as a case report for an individual patient or a randomized double-blinded controlled clinical trial) and the endpoints measured (such as survival or quality of life) affect the strength of the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The various types of study designs, in descending order of strength, include:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Randomized controlled clinical trials (double-blinded or non-blinded) are considered the gold standard of study design. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Meta-analyses of randomized studies offer a quantitative synthesis of previously conducted studies. The strength of evidence from a meta-analysis is based on the quality of the conduct of individual studies. Meta-analyses of randomized studies are placed in the same category of strength of evidence as are randomized studies. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Nonrandomized controlled clinical trials &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Case series: Population-based, consecutive series, consecutive cases (not population-based) or nonconsecutive cases. These clinical experiences are the weakest form of study design, but often they are the only available or practical information. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Several rating systems are used by guideline developers to evaluate the strength of the evidence for their recommendations. These systems vary in the nomenclature used (alphabetical versus numeric), but there is usually reasonable equivalence in the definitions across the levels of evidence. Each recommendation in this document provides the level of evidence for the recommendation (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence&quot; field), as well as the reference for the Primary Guideline(s) that were adapted or contributed most to the wording of the recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="112" OrdBy="440" ID="413" Name="Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations" Type="picklist-choice"><FieldValue Value="Expert Consensus (Consensus Development Conference)" /></Field><Field FieldID="145" OrdBy="445" ID="414" Name="Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stroke Guideline Development Framework&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The conceptual framework used to guide the identification, selection, development and updating of the Canadian best practice recommendations was the Practice Guideline Evaluation and Adaptation Cycle of Graham and colleagues. This cycle involves the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Establishing an interprofessional guideline development team &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Establishing a guideline appraisal process using a validated tool &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Systematic searching for existing practice guidelines &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Appraising the quality, currency and content of guideline recommendations &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Adopting or adapting guidelines for local use &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Obtaining external expert feedback on the proposed recommendations &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Selecting final recommendations &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Obtaining official endorsement &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Establishing an ongoing review and update process &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The methodology for the first edition of the &lt;em&gt;Canadian Best Practice Recommendations for Stroke Care (2006)&lt;/em&gt; was based on this framework, and it is applied, with some enhancements, to develop each update. The key activities undertaken in the guideline development process are highlighted below.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leadership and Participants&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Canadian Stroke Strategy (CSS) Best Practices and Standards Working Group has overall responsibility for the development and update process. The 2010 update cycle was led by a subgroup of the Working Group and managed by the Director of Performance and Standards at the Canadian Stroke Network (CSN).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An interprofessional group of experts in stroke care participated in topic-specific task groups convened to review, draft, and revise recommendation statements for their topic. Recognized experts within the topic area chaired each task group, and members included stroke neurologists, physiatrists, nurses, emergency physicians, paramedics, physical therapists, occupational therapists, dietitians, speech&amp;ndash;language pathologists, pharmacists, stroke survivors, education experts, and professionals from other disciplines as required. This interprofessional approach ensured that all relevant health disciplines for a particular topic area were represented in the development of the recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A national interprofessional consensus panel was convened to provide further input into the recommendations and a final review was conducted by an external group of stroke and methods experts before release.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identification of Key Topic Areas and Core Reference Guidelines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The process used to identify key topic areas and core reference guidelines is outlined below.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;An ongoing structured literature review is conducted every two to three months to monitor emerging evidence and new or updated stroke-related guidelines. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Scans of the primary research literature focused on meta-analyses, systematic reviews, randomized trials, quasi-experimental studies, other related guidelines and reports, and Canadian consensus statements by healthcare professional groups. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The strength of the research evidence was graded using a standardized grading system (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence&quot; field). In some areas, the levels of evidence for a given topic varied among selected guidelines or research papers depending on the nature of the research. The totality of the information for each topic provided a comprehensive understanding of the strength of the evidence, the state of the research, and gaps for future inquiry. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;A detailed literature search for international stroke-related guidelines was also undertaken. The Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation (AGREE) tool was applied to determine the quality of the guidelines. This tool can be used to assess the process of guideline development based on six domains: identification of a clinical area to promote best practice, stakeholder involvement, rigour of development, clarity and presentation, applicability, and editorial independence. Based on the results of the appraisals, several guidelines met the Working Group criteria to be considered as 'reference guidelines' for the development process. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Once the high-quality guidelines were identified, a content review was conducted to identify a list of stroke topic areas that were supported by the highest levels of evidence. A secondary list of topic areas with lower levels of supporting evidence but considered being key system drivers (such as acute diagnostic imaging with computed tomography scans) was also compiled. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Potential topics that emerged from the research and guideline review were compiled into a &quot;Topic Matrix&quot; to allow easy comparison by topic and strength of evidence. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The topic areas and levels of supporting evidence were reviewed and debated by the Working Group. Using a consensus model, a final list of stroke topic areas that were considered most relevant to optimal stroke care in Canada was developed. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Topic areas were assigned to one of eight task groups to develop detailed recommendation statements. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See Appendix 7 in the original guideline document for a list of guidelines and significant research trials that were considered during the 2010 update process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Synthesis of Best Practice Recommendations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Expert task groups (see Appendix 2 in the original guideline document for a list of task group members) were convened for each segment of the continuum of stroke care, to select relevant recommendations arising from the evidence review and if necessary draft new recommendations based on emerging evidence. Task groups were instructed that recommendations could address structure and/or processes of care at either the system level or the patient level, and that they could be taken directly from other existing guidelines, adapted from one or more guidelines, or written by the task group. Appropriate references were to accompany all recommendation statements derived from evidence or existing guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the 2010 update, each task group participated in a series of teleconferences between May 2009 and February 2010 to complete their research reviews and develop the recommendations. The Director of Performance and Standards at the CSN participated in all teleconferences to ensure consistency, standardization, and rigour of development across task groups.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See the original guideline document for more information on the recommendation development process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="146" OrdBy="450" ID="415" Name="Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not applicable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="148" OrdBy="460" ID="417" Name="Cost Analysis" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A formal cost analysis was not performed and published costs analyses were not reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="104" OrdBy="465" ID="418" Name="Method of Guideline Validation" Type="picklist-choice"><FieldValue Value="External Peer Review" /><FieldValue Value="Internal Peer Review" /></Field><Field FieldID="130" OrdBy="470" ID="419" Name="Description of Method of Guideline Validation" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;National Expert Consensus Process&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Following completion of the task group work, the draft recommendations and supporting information were presented for discussion and decision-making to a broad group of stakeholders at a national expert consensus meeting held in Toronto, Ontario in April, 2010 (see Appendix 3 of the original guideline document for a list of consensus participants). Consensus participants included the Best Practices Working Group, the chairs of each task group, and invited opinion leaders, stroke survivors, and healthcare professionals external to the development process. The selection of consensus participants was based on ensuring representation from stroke-related health professional disciplines, all sectors of the healthcare continuum, all provinces in Canada, and rural and urban work environments.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Consensus participants received the draft recommendations, including proposed changes to existing recommendations as well as new recommendations, in advance of the consensus meeting. They were asked to review the information, provide feedback to the Working Group prior to the meeting, and indicate their degree of support for each recommendation.

All members of the public should know how to take the appropriate actions &amp;mdash; that is, to call 9-1-1 or their local emergency number [&lt;strong&gt;Evidence Level B&lt;/strong&gt;]. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Public education should include information that stroke can affect persons of any age &amp;mdash; from newborns and children to adults - and be aware of the benefits of early medical attention [&lt;strong&gt;Evidence Level C&lt;/strong&gt;]. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning Signs and Symptoms of Stroke&lt;/strong&gt; (Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.heartandstroke.com&quot; title=&quot;Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada Web site&quot;&gt;www.heartandstroke.com&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weakness&lt;/strong&gt;: Sudden weakness, numbness or tingling in the face, arm or leg &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trouble speaking&lt;/strong&gt;: Sudden temporary loss of speech or trouble understanding speech &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vision problems&lt;/strong&gt;: Sudden loss of vision, particularly in one eye, or double vision &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Headache&lt;/strong&gt;: Sudden severe and unusual headache &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dizziness&lt;/strong&gt;: Sudden loss of balance, especially with any of the above signs&amp;nbsp; &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;ACTION: Call 9-1-1 or your local emergency number IMMEDIATELY.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rationale&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to stroke, &lt;em&gt;time is brain&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Stroke is a medical emergency. Most people do not recognize the 5 main symptoms of stroke and therefore do not seek immediate medical attention. It is critical that people with ischemic strokes (caused by a blocked artery) arrive in the emergency department as soon as possible, and within at least 3.5 hours of symptom onset, if they are to be eligible to receive clot-busting treatment. In the case of strokes caused by hemorrhage or leaking arteries in the brain, earlier assessment and treatment may allow time for life-saving intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Efforts to enhance emergency medical system response to stroke calls and to encourage the public to recognize stroke signs and symptoms and contact emergency medical services result in timelier treatment and better outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Definitions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary of Definitions for Levels of Evidence*&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;1&quot; summary=&quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;thead&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;tr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;th valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Grade&lt;/th&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;th class=&quot;Center&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Criteria&lt;/th&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;/tr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/thead&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;tbody&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;tr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;th class=&quot;Center&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;A&lt;/th&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Strong recommendation.

Additionally, these recommendations can be valuable tools and information sources for anyone advocating for improved stroke care services. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The recommendations in this document are better seen as guidelines rather than rigid rules.

Publication and dissemination strategies have changed in response to user needs and feedback. In 2006, printed documents and CDs were provided to all contacts in the CSS database, to others on request, and to interested groups throughout Canada and internationally. The 2008 Update was published through the &lt;em&gt;Canadian Medical Association Journal&lt;/em&gt; (CMAJ) as a supplement to subscribers and posted on the CMAJ website with links to the document on the CSS website; the CSS provided a limited number of printed copies upon request. The 2010 Update is available on the Canadian Stroke Network (CSN) Best Practices web site, at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.strokebestpractices.ca/&quot; title=&quot;CSN Web site&quot;&gt;www.strokebestpractices.ca&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also on the website, patients and the general public can find &lt;em&gt;A Patient's Guide to the Canadian Best Practice Recommendations for Stroke Care&lt;/em&gt;. The CSS created the patient's guide in recognition of the fact that the best practice recommendations are lengthy and written primarily for a healthcare audience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The CSS encourages provincial or territorial and regional stroke strategies to adopt the &lt;em&gt;Canadian Best Practice Recommendations for Stroke Care&lt;/em&gt; in their entirety.
