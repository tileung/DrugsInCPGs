An initial search of the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL databases for guidelines and articles published from January 1, 1995, to December 2002, was conducted using the following search terms: &quot;delirium management&quot;, &quot;dementia management&quot;, &quot;depression management&quot;, &quot;geriatrics&quot;, &quot;practice guideline(s)&quot;, &quot;clinical practice guideline(s)&quot;, &quot;standards&quot;, &quot;consensus statement(s)&quot;, &quot;consensus&quot;, &quot;evidence-based guidelines&quot;, and &quot;best practice guidelines&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One individual searched an established list of websites for content related to the topic area. This list of sites, reviewed and updated in October 2002, was compiled based on existing knowledge of evidence-based practice Web sites, known guideline developers, and recommendations from the literature. Presence or absence of guidelines was noted for each site searched, as well as date searched. The websites at times did not house a guideline but directed to another website or source for guideline retrieval. Guidelines were either downloaded, if full versions were available, or were ordered by phone/e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A website search for existing guidelines on delirium, dementia, and depression was conducted via the search engine &quot;Google,&quot; using the search terms identified above. One individual conducted this search, noting the search term results, the websites reviewed, date, and a summary of findings. The search results were further critiqued by a second individual who identified guidelines and literature not previously retrieved.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, panel members were already in possession of a few of the identified guidelines. In some instances, a guideline was identified by panel members and not found through the previous search strategies. These were guidelines that were developed by local groups or specific professional associations. The results of this strategy revealed 21 guidelines and numerous articles related to delirium, dementia, and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The final step in determining whether clinical practice guidelines would be critically appraised was to have two individuals screen the guidelines based on the specific inclusion criteria. These criteria were determined by panel consensus:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Guideline was in English, international in scope. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Guideline was dated no earlier than 1996. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Guideline was strictly about the topic areas (delirium, dementia, depression). &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Guideline was evidence-based (e.g., contained references, description of evidence, sources of evidence). &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Guideline was available and accessible for retrieval. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Twelve guidelines were deemed suitable for critical review using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) instrument.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2010 Supplement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Literature Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One individual searched an established list of websites for guidelines and other relevant content. The list was compiled based on existing knowledge of evidence-based practice websites and recommendations from the literature. Members of the panel critically appraised 17 national and international guidelines, published since 2004, using the AGREE instrument (The AGREE Collaboration, 2001). From this review, nine guidelines were identified to inform the review processes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Concurrent with the review of existing guidelines, a search for recent literature relevant to the scope of the guideline was conducted with guidance from the Team Leader. A search of electronic databases, (Medline, CINAHL, and EMBASE), was conducted by a health sciences librarian. A Research Assistant completed the inclusion/exclusion review, quality appraisal and data extraction of the retrieved studies, and prepared a summary of the literature findings. The comprehensive data tables and reference list were provided to all panel members.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A summary of the review process is provided in the Review/Revision Process flow chart in the original guideline document.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="136" OrdBy="415" ID="408" Name="Number of Source Documents" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 2004 Guideline&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Following the appraisal process, the guideline development panel identified eight guidelines to develop the recommendations cited in the guideline.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2010 Supplement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The search yielded 2507 abstracts and 17 guidelines; 162 studies and 9 guidelines were retrieved for review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="115" OrdBy="420" ID="409" Name="Methods Used to Assess the Quality and Strength of the Evidence" Type="picklist-choice"><FieldValue Value="Weighting According to a Rating Scheme (Scheme Given)" /></Field><Field FieldID="149" OrdBy="425" ID="410" Name="Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level of Evidence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ia&lt;/strong&gt; - Evidence obtained from meta-analysis or systematic review of randomized controlled trials.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ib&lt;/strong&gt; - Evidence obtained from at least one randomized controlled trial.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IIa&lt;/strong&gt; - Evidence obtained from at least one well-designed controlled study without randomization.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IIb&lt;/strong&gt; - Evidence obtained from at least one other type of well-designed quasi-experimental study, without randomization.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;III&lt;/strong&gt; - Evidence obtained from well-designed nonexperimental descriptive studies, such as comparative studies, correlation studies, and case studies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IV&lt;/strong&gt; - Evidence obtained from expert committee reports or opinions and/or clinical experiences of respected authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="116" OrdBy="430" ID="411" Name="Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence" Type="picklist-many"><FieldValue Value="Review of Published Meta-Analyses" /><FieldValue Value="Systematic Review with Evidence Tables" /></Field><Field FieldID="150" OrdBy="435" ID="412" Name="Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not stated&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="112" OrdBy="440" ID="413" Name="Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations" Type="picklist-choice"><FieldValue Value="Expert Consensus" /></Field><Field FieldID="145" OrdBy="445" ID="414" Name="Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 2004 Guideline&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In January of 2003, a panel of nurses and researchers with expertise in practice, education, and research related to gerontology and geriatric mental health care was convened under the auspices of the Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO). At the onset, the panel discussed and came to a consensus on the scope of the best practice guideline.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Following the extraction of identified recommendations and content from eight guidelines, the panel underwent a process of review, discussion, and consensus on the key evidence-based assessment criteria.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The panel members divided into subgroups to undergo specific activities using the short-listed guidelines, other literature, and additional resources for the purpose of drafting recommendations for nursing interventions. This process yielded a draft set of recommendations.

In order to meet this commitment, a monitoring and revision process has been established for each guideline. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A panel of nurses was assembled for this review, comprised of members from the original development panel as well as other recommended individuals with particular expertise in this practice area. A structured evidence review based on the scope of the original guideline and supported by three clinical questions was conducted to capture the relevant literature and guidelines published since the publication of the original guideline in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Initial findings regarding the impact of the current evidence, based on the original recommendations, were summarized and circulated to the review panel.

Guidelines should not be applied in a &quot;cookbook&quot; fashion but used as a tool to assist in decision making for individualized client care, as well as ensuring that appropriate structures and supports are in place to provide the best possible care. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Nurses, other healthcare professionals and administrators who are leading and facilitating practice changes will find this document valuable for the development of policies, procedures, protocols, educational programs, assessment and documentation tools. It is recommended that the nursing best practice guidelines be used as a resource tool. Nurses providing direct client care will benefit from reviewing the recommendations, the evidence in support of the recommendations and the process that was used to develop the guidelines. However, it is highly recommended that practice settings/environments adapt these guidelines in formats that would be user-friendly for daily use. This guideline has some suggested formats for such local adaptation and tailoring. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;These best practice guidelines are related only to nursing practice and are not intended to take into account fiscal efficiencies. These guidelines are not binding for nurses and their use should be flexible to accommodate client/family wishes and local circumstances. They neither constitute a liability nor discharge from liability. While every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the contents at the time of publication, neither the authors nor the Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) give any guarantee as to the accuracy of the information contained in them nor accept any liability, with respect to loss, damage, injury or expense arising from any such errors or omission in the contents of this work. Any reference throughout the document to specific pharmaceutical products as examples does not imply endorsement of any of these products. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;It is acknowledged that the individual competencies of nurses varies between nurses and across categories of nursing professionals (registered nurses [RNs] and registered practical nurses [RPNs]) and are based on knowledge, skills, attitudes, critical analysis, and decision making which are enhanced over time by experience and education. It is expected that individual nurses will perform only those aspects of care for which they have received appropriate education and experience. Since care strategies for delirium, dementia and depression are based on accurate screening assessment of these conditions, the development panel for this guideline strongly recommends the implementation of this guideline in conjunction with the RNAO (2003) Best Practice Guideline entitled Caregiving Strategies for Older Adults with Delirium, Dementia and Depression. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;It is expected that nurses, both RNs and RPNs, will seek appropriate consultation in instances where the client's care needs surpass the individual's ability to act independently. It is acknowledged that effective health care depends on a coordinated interdisciplinary approach incorporating ongoing communication between health professionals and clients, ever mindful of the personal preferences and unique needs of each individual client. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Similar to the original guideline publication, the supplement needs to be reviewed and applied, based on the specific needs of the organization or practice setting/environment, as well as the needs and wishes of the client. This supplement should be used in conjunction with the original guideline: Caregiving Strategies for Older Adults with Delirium, Dementia and Depression (RNAO, 2003) as a tool to assist in decision-making for individualized client care, as well as ensuring that appropriate structures and supports are in place to provide the best possible care. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;" /></Field></Section><Section SecID="434" OrdBy="1000" Name="Implementation of the Guideline"><Field FieldID="131" OrdBy="1010" ID="436" Name="Description of Implementation Strategy" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Best practice guidelines can only be successfully implemented if there are adequate planning, resources, organizational and administrative support, as well as appropriate facilitation. The Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO), through a panel of nurses, researchers, and administrators, has developed the &lt;em&gt;Toolkit: Implementation of Clinical Practice Guidelines&lt;/em&gt; based on available evidence, theoretical perspectives, and consensus. The Toolkit is recommended for guiding the implementation of any clinical practice guideline in a health care organization.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Toolkit provides step-by-step directions to individuals and groups involved in planning, coordinating, and facilitating guideline implementation. Specifically, the Toolkit addresses the following key steps:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Identifying a well-developed, evidence-based clinical practice guideline &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Identification, assessment, and engagement of stakeholders &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Assessment of environmental readiness for guideline implementation &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Identifying and planning evidence-based implementation strategies &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Planning and implementing evaluation &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Identifying and securing required resources for implementation &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Implementing practice guidelines that result in successful practice changes and positive clinical impact is a complex undertaking. The Toolkit is one key resource for managing this process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluation and Monitoring&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Organizations implementing the recommendations in this nursing best practice guideline are advised to consider how the implementation and its impact will be monitored and evaluated. A table found in the original guideline document, based on the framework outlined in the RNAO &lt;em&gt;Toolkit: Implementation of clinical practice guidelines&lt;/em&gt; (2002), illustrates some suggested indicators for monitoring and evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implementation Tips&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario, the guideline development panel and evaluation team have compiled a list of implementation tips to assist healthcare organizations or healthcare disciplines who are interested in implementing this guideline.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A summary of these strategies follows:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Have a dedicated person such as an advanced practice nurse or a clinical resource nurse who will provide support, clinical expertise and leadership. The individual should also have good interpersonal, facilitation and project management skills. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Establish a steering committee comprised of key stakeholders and members who are committed to leading the initiative. Keep a work plan to track activities, responsibilities and timelines. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Provide educational sessions and ongoing support for implementation. The education sessions may consist of Power Point presentations, facilitator's guides, handouts, and case studies. Binders, posters and pocket cards may be used as ongoing reminders of the training. This guideline contains many resources, especially in the appendices, which nurses may use when developing the educational materials. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Provide organizational support, such as having the structures in place to facilitate the implementation. For examples, hiring replacement staff so participants will not be distracted by concerns about work, and having an organizational policy that reflects the value of best practices through policies and procedures and documentation tools. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Teamwork, collaborative assessment and treatment planning with the client and family through interdisciplinary work are beneficial. It is essential to be cognizant of and to tap the resources that are available in the community. Appendices I and K in the original guideline document highlight some of the resources that are available in the community. Another example would be linking and developing partnerships with regional geriatric programs for referral process. The RNAO's Advanced Clinical/Practice Fellowship (ACPF) Project is another way that registered nurses in Ontario may apply for a fellowship and have an opportunity to work with a mentor who has clinical expertise in delirium, dementia and depression. With the ACPF, the nurse fellow will also have the opportunity to learn more about new resources. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the tips mentioned above, the RNAO has developed resources that are available on the website. A Toolkit for implementing guidelines can be helpful if used appropriately. A brief description of this Toolkit can be found in Appendix Z in the original guideline document.
