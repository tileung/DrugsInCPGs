Reviewers included trials with primary care&amp;ndash;relevant counseling on physical activity (for example, aerobic activities, such as walking, cycling, or swimming, or resistance training) or healthful diet interventions (for example, appropriate calorie intake; increased intake of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and fiber; balanced intake of fats; or decreased sodium). Reviewers excluded interventions primarily aimed at weight loss or those that provided controlled diets or supervised physical activity. Primary care&amp;ndash;relevant counseling included interventions that were conducted in, judged feasible to be conducted in (such as phone or electronic interventions), or potentially referable from a primary care setting. Interventions had to be compared with usual care, a minimal intervention, or an attention-control group. Reviewers excluded interventions that targeted persons with known hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, or cardiovascular disease and trials in which more than 50% of the population had known heart disease or any one or a combination of these risk factors. They required a minimum follow-up of 6 months after randomization. A priori outcomes included true health outcomes (morbidity or mortality related to cardiovascular disease); intermediate outcomes and physiologic changes associated with health outcomes (blood pressure, lipid profile, fasting glucose level and glucose tolerance, and adiposity); and behavioral outcomes (any self-reported change in physical activity or dietary intake). Cost-effectiveness or cost-related outcomes were not included. For harms, reviewers included any observational studies that reported serious cardiovascular harms, such as acute cardiac events during or immediately after physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="136" OrdBy="415" ID="408" Name="Number of Source Documents" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data from 73 studies (109 articles) were included.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="115" OrdBy="420" ID="409" Name="Methods Used to Assess the Quality and Strength of the Evidence" Type="picklist-choice"><FieldValue Value="Weighting According to a Rating Scheme (Scheme Given)" /></Field><Field FieldID="149" OrdBy="425" ID="410" Name="Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Articles that met the inclusion criteria were critically appraised by 2 reviewers using the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence design-specific quality criteria (see Appendix B, Table 2 in the Evidence Synthesis [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="116" OrdBy="430" ID="411" Name="Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence" Type="picklist-many"><FieldValue Value="Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials" /><FieldValue Value="Review of Published Meta-Analyses" /><FieldValue Value="Systematic Review with Evidence Tables" /></Field><Field FieldID="150" OrdBy="435" ID="412" Name="Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)&lt;/strong&gt;: A systematic evidence review was prepared by the Oregon Evidence-based Practice Center for&amp;nbsp;the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Extraction and Quality Assessment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Articles that met the inclusion criteria were critically appraised by 2 reviewers using the USPSTF and National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence design-specific quality criteria.

Good-quality studies met all of the specified quality criteria, whereas fair-quality studies did not but had no fatal flaws in the design, execution, or reporting of the study. Poor-quality studies were excluded from this review.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For included studies, 1 investigator extracted data on study setting, populations, interventions, and prespecified outcomes into standardized evidence tables and a second investigator verified all extracted data.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Synthesis and Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Reviewers conducted random-effects meta-analyses to estimate the effect size of counseling on all intermediate health outcomes and behavioral outcomes. They combined all trials with a given outcome and conducted separate analyses for each of the 3 intervention targets (physical activity, healthful diet, and combined) and, if applicable, for the specific dietary message (sodium reduction, focus on fruits and vegetables only, or general low-fat or heart-healthy dietary counseling). Analyses were stratified by estimated intervention intensity (low [&amp;le;30 minutes], medium [between 31 minutes and 6 hours of contact], or high [&amp;gt;6 hours of contact]). Trials were also categorized by population risk as being unselected or selected only on the basis of age; selected for suboptimal behavior (such as sedentary behavior or poor dietary intake); or selected for individual or population risk factors for increased incidence of cardiovascular disease (such as mildly elevated diastolic blood pressure or fasting glucose or serum lipid levels, obesity, or poverty or poor access to health care).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Reviewers assessed the presence of statistical heterogeneity among the studies by using standard chi-square tests and estimated the magnitude of heterogeneity by using the &lt;em&gt;I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; statistic. Tests of publication bias to determine whether the distribution of the effect sizes was symmetric with respect to the precision measure were performed by using funnel plots and the Egger linear regression method. Meta-regressions were performed on the basis of the random-effects models to examine the effect of 4 a priori variables of heterogeneity (intervention intensity, intervention target, study population risk, and recruitment method [volunteer vs. study-identified]) on effect size. To interpret effect sizes of standardized mean differences, the Cohen &lt;em&gt;d&lt;/em&gt; statistic was used, in which an effect size of 0.2 to 0.3 generally represents a small effect; 0.5, a moderate effect; and 0.8, a large effect.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All analyses were performed by using Stata, version 10.0 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="112" OrdBy="440" ID="413" Name="Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations" Type="picklist-choice"><FieldValue Value="Balance Sheets" /><FieldValue Value="Expert Consensus" /></Field><Field FieldID="145" OrdBy="445" ID="414" Name="Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) systematically reviews the evidence concerning both the benefits and harms of widespread implementation of a preventive service.

On the basis of this assessment, the USPSTF assigns a letter grade to each preventive service signifying its recommendation about provision of the service (see table below). An important, but often challenging, step is determining the balance between benefits and harms to estimate &quot;net benefit&quot; (that is, benefits minus harms).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Table 1.

For screening topics, this standard could be met by a large randomized, controlled trial (RCT) in a representative asymptomatic population with follow-up of all members of both the group &quot;invited for screening&quot; and the group &quot;not invited for screening.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Direct RCT evidence about screening is often unavailable, so the Task Force considers indirect evidence. To guide its selection of indirect evidence, the Task Force constructs a &quot;chain of evidence&quot; within an analytic framework. For each key question, the body of pertinent literature is critically appraised, focusing on the following 6 questions:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Do the studies have the appropriate research design to answer the key question(s)? &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;To what extent are the existing studies of high quality? (i.e., what is the internal validity?) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;To what extent are the results of the studies generalizable to the general U.S. primary care population and situation? (i.e., what is the external validity?) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;How many studies have been conducted that address the key question(s)? How large are the studies? (i.e., what is the precision of the evidence?) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;How consistent are the results of the studies? &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Are there additional factors that assist the USPSTF in drawing conclusions (e.g., presence or absence of dose&amp;ndash;response effects, fit within a biologic model)? &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The next step in the Task Force process is to use the evidence from the key questions to assess whether there would be net benefit if the service were implemented. In 2001, the USPSTF published an article that documented its systematic processes of evidence evaluation and recommendation development. At that time, the Task Force's overall assessment of evidence was described as good, fair, or poor. The Task Force realized that this rating seemed to apply only to how well studies were conducted and did not fully capture all of the issues that go into an overall assessment of the evidence about net benefit. To avoid confusion, the Task Force has changed its terminology. Whereas individual study quality will continue to be characterized as good, fair, or poor, the term certainty will now be used to describe the Task Force's assessment of the overall body of evidence about net benefit of a preventive service and the likelihood that the assessment is correct. Certainty will be determined by considering all 6 questions listed above; the judgment about certainty will be described as high, moderate, or low.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In making its assessment of certainty about net benefit, the evaluation of the evidence from each key question plays a primary role. It is important to note that the Task Force makes recommendations for real-world medical practice in the United States and must determine to what extent the evidence for each key question&amp;mdash;even evidence from screening RCTs or treatment RCTs&amp;mdash;can be applied to the general primary care population. Frequently, studies are conducted in highly selected populations under special conditions. The Task Force must consider differences between the general primary care population and the populations studied in RCTs and make judgments about the likelihood of observing the same effect in actual practice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is also important to note that one of the key questions in the analytic framework refers to the potential harms of the preventive service. The Task Force considers the evidence about the benefits and harms of preventive services separately and equally. Data about harms are often obtained from observational studies because harms observed in RCTs may not be representative of those found in usual practice and because some harms are not completely measured and reported in RCTs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Putting the body of evidence for all key questions together as a chain, the Task Force assesses the certainty of net benefit of a preventive service by asking the 6 major questions listed above. The Task Force would rate a body of convincing evidence about the benefits of a service that, for example, derives from several RCTs of screening in which the estimate of benefits can be generalized to the general primary care population as &quot;high&quot; certainty (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of Recommendations&quot; field). The Task Force would rate a body of evidence that was not clearly applicable to general practice or has other defects in quality, research design, or consistency of studies as &quot;moderate&quot; certainty. Certainty is &quot;low&quot; when, for example, there are gaps in the evidence linking parts of the analytic framework, when evidence to determine the harms of treatment is unavailable, or when evidence about the benefits of treatment is insufficient. Table 4 in the methodology document listed below (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) summarizes the current terminology used by the Task Force to describe the critical assessment of evidence at all 3 levels: individual studies, key questions, and overall certainty of net benefit of the preventive service.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sawaya GF et al.

Before the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) makes its final determinations about recommendations on a given preventive service, the Evidence-based Practice Center and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality send a draft evidence review to 4 to 6 external experts and to Federal agencies and professional and disease-based health organizations with interests in the topic. The experts are asked to examine the review critically for accuracy and completeness and to respond to a series of specific questions about the document. After assembling these external review comments and documenting the proposed response to key comments, the topic team presents this information to the USPSTF in memo form. In this way, the USPSTF can consider these external comments before it votes on its recommendations about the service. Draft recommendation statements are then circulated for comment among reviewers representing professional societies, voluntary organizations, and Federal agencies, as well as posted on the Task Force Web site for public comment. These comments are discussed before the final recommendations are confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Response to Public Comment&lt;/span&gt;. A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from 22 February to 22 March 2011. Sixty-five responses were received during this period. In response to these comments, the USPSTF clarified the target population throughout the recommendation statement and refined the terminology describing both behavioral and intermediate outcomes. It added information to the Interventions section and expanded the Implementation section to provide further guidance to clinicians. It also added the Other Approaches to Prevention section to highlight important public health interventions addressing diet and exercise and expanded the Recommendation of Others section to include recommendations from other professional associations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Recommendations of Others&lt;/span&gt;.

It does not apply to adults who have known CVD, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or diabetes. The USPSTF is in the process of updating its recommendation on behavioral counseling interventions for this group.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effective Behavioral Counseling Interventions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Studies of medium- and high-intensity behavioral counseling interventions, but not low-intensity interventions, showed beneficial effects on behavioral and intermediate health outcomes. The intensity of the intervention was categorized by total patient contact time as low (1 to 30 minutes), medium (31 to 360 minutes), or high (&amp;gt;360 minutes).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In general, low-intensity interventions consisted of only mailed materials or of 1 to 2 single, brief sessions with primary care clinicians or other trained persons. Medium-intensity interventions involved a range of 3 to 24 phone sessions or 1 to 8 in-person sessions. High-intensity interventions involved a range of 4 to 20 in-person group sessions and were the only interventions to report sustained benefits beyond 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No high-intensity interventions and few medium-intensity interventions involved primary care clinicians as the providers of the intervention. Most interventions were delivered by health educators or nurses, counselors or psychologists, dieticians or nutritionists, or exercise instructors or physiologists.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In adults with a diastolic blood pressure of 80 to 89 mm Hg, high-intensity behavioral interventions to reduce dietary sodium content were associated with a clinically significant reduction in blood pressure (decreases of 1.9 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure and 1.0 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure) and subsequent cardiovascular events.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Approaches to Prevention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The counseling interventions that were feasible in the primary care setting or were referable that the USPSTF reviewed demonstrated only small to moderate changes in behavior or intermediate health outcomes. Behavioral counseling may be more effective if delivered in the context of broader public health interventions that encourage healthy lifestyles.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many public health resources addressing diet and physical activity may be useful resources for primary care clinicians. The U.S. Departments of Agriculture and Health and Human Services have jointly issued dietary guidelines for the general population. These guidelines recommend a diet that includes various fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and fiber; is low in saturated fat, cholesterol, and sodium; and balances calories with physical activity to maintain a healthy weight. The &quot;2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans&quot; recommends that adults exercise for at least 150 minutes per week and include muscle-strengthening exercises at least twice per week.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Million Hearts campaign is a national private&amp;ndash;public initiative sponsored by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that aims to decrease the number of heart attacks and strokes by 1 million over the next 5 years. It emphasizes the use of effective clinical preventive services combined with multifaceted policy interventions.

They should not be construed as an official position of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;" /></Field></Section><Section SecID="434" OrdBy="1000" Name="Implementation of the Guideline"><Field FieldID="131" OrdBy="1010" ID="436" Name="Description of Implementation Strategy" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General Implementation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The experiences of the first and second U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), as well as that of other evidence-based guideline efforts, have highlighted the importance of identifying effective ways to implement clinical recommendations. Practice guidelines are relatively weak tools for changing clinical practice when used in isolation. To effect change, guidelines must be coupled with strategies to improve their acceptance and feasibility. Such strategies include enlisting the support of local opinion leaders, using reminder systems for clinicians and patients, adopting standing orders, and audit and feedback of information to clinicians about their compliance with recommended practice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the case of preventive services guidelines, implementation needs to go beyond traditional dissemination and promotion efforts to recognize the added patient and clinician barriers that affect preventive care. These include clinicians' ambivalence about whether preventive medicine is part of their job, the psychological and practical challenges that patients face in changing behaviors, lack of access to health care or of insurance coverage for preventive services for some patients, competing pressures within the context of shorter office visits, and the lack of organized systems in most practices to ensure the delivery of recommended preventive care.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dissemination strategies have changed dramatically in this age of electronic information. While recognizing the continuing value of journals and other print formats for dissemination, the USPSTF Task Force will make all its products available through its &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/&quot; title=&quot;USPSTF Web site&quot;&gt;Web site&lt;/a&gt;. The combination of electronic access and extensive material in the public domain should make it easier for a broad audience of users to access USPSTF materials and adapt them for their local needs. Online access to USPSTF products also opens up new possibilities for the appearance of the annual, pocket-size Guide to Clinical Preventive Services.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To be successful, approaches for implementing prevention have to be tailored to the local level and deal with the specific barriers at a given site, typically requiring the redesign of systems of care. Such a systems approach to prevention has had notable success in established staff-model health maintenance organizations, by addressing organization of care, emphasizing a philosophy of prevention, and altering the training and incentives for clinicians. Staff-model plans also benefit from integrated information systems that can track the use of needed services and generate automatic reminders aimed at patients and clinicians, some of the most consistently successful interventions. Information systems remain a major challenge for individual clinicians' offices, however, as well as for looser affiliations of practices in network-model managed care and independent practice associations, where data on patient visits, referrals, and test results are not always centralized.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implementation of This Guideline&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Medium- or high-intensity behavioral interventions to promote a healthful diet and physical activity may be provided to individual patients in primary care settings or in other sectors of the health care system after referral from a primary care clinician. In addition, clinicians may offer healthful diet and physical activity interventions by referring the patient to community-based organizations. Strong links between the primary care setting and community-based resources may improve the delivery of these services.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If individual risk for CVD is uncertain, several calculators and models are available to quantify a person's risk for cardiac events over the next 10 years. The Framingham-based Adult Treatment Panel III calculator (available at &lt;a href=&quot;http://hp2010.nhlbihin.net/atpiii/calculator.asp&quot; title=&quot;Framingham-based Adult Treatment Panel III calculator  Web site&quot;&gt;http://hp2010.nhlbihin.net/atpiii/calculator.asp&lt;/a&gt;) performs well for the U.S. population. Persons with a 10-year risk for CVD greater than 20% are generally considered to be at high risk, those with a 10-year risk less than 10% are considered to be at low risk, and those in the 10% to 20% range are considered to be at intermediate risk. Persons at higher risk may benefit from counseling interventions more than persons at low risk, because even small improvements in intermediate outcomes in those at higher risk may result in clinically meaningful reductions in CVD events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="117" OrdBy="1015" ID="437" Name="Implementation Tools" Type="picklist-many"><FieldValue Value="Foreign Language Translations" /><FieldValue Value="Mobile Device Resources" /><FieldValue Value="Patient Resources" /><FieldValue Value="Pocket Guide/Reference Cards" /><FieldValue Value="Staff Training/Competency Material" /></Field></Section><Section SecID="439" OrdBy="1100" Name="Institute of Medicine (IOM) National Healthcare Quality Report Categories"><Field FieldID="50" OrdBy="1105" ID="440" Name="IOM Care Need" Type="picklist-many"><FieldValue Value="Staying Healthy" /></Field><Field FieldID="51" OrdBy="1110" ID="441" Name="IOM Domain" Type="picklist-many"><FieldValue Value="Effectiveness" /><FieldValue Value="Patient-centeredness" /></Field></Section><Section SecID="442" OrdBy="1200" Name="Identifying Information and Availability"><Field FieldID="97" OrdBy="1201" ID="392" Name="Bibliographic Source(s)" Type="citation"><FieldValue Value="&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.
