For the first review of dabigatran trials in the relevant indication MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, the manufacturer's own internal databases (BILIT, pre-BILIT and IDEA), Clinicaltrials.gov, and the proceedings of five relevant conferences were searched. Only English language studies were sought for this review, therefore language bias can't be ruled out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the second review of all potentially relevant pharmacological interventions for the prevention of stroke in patients with AF, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), BIOSIS, and the reference lists of articles, reviews and meta-analyses were searched. No date or language restrictions were applied to the searches for the second review.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The search strategies used were reported in full for each section of the clinical review (clinical evidence, mixed treatment comparison [MTC], non-RCT evidence, adverse events) and seem appropriate; no relevant studies appear to have been missed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria Used in the Study Selection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The inclusion and exclusion criteria applied in the MS to select studies for the first review of the efficacy and safety of dabigatran were:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Population: Adults (&amp;ge;18 years) with AF&lt;br /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;Intervention: Dabigatran&lt;br /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;Comparator: Another treatment modality or placebo&lt;br /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;Outcomes: Prevention of stroke&lt;br /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;Study design: Randomised controlled trials or observational studies&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The inclusion and exclusion criteria applied to select studies for the second review of other therapeutic regimens were:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Population: Adults (&amp;ge;18 years) with AF&lt;br /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;Intervention: Any treatment used to prevent stroke in AF&lt;br /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;Comparator: Any alternative treatment used to prevent stroke in AF or placebo&lt;br /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;Outcomes: Prevention of stroke&lt;br /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;Study design: Randomised controlled trials&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The inclusion criteria were applied by more than one reviewer in both reviews, reducing the potential for selection bias and missed studies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost-effectiveness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Literature Search&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The manufacturer carried out a comprehensive search of economic evaluation studies evaluating the cost-effectiveness of dabigatran etexilate in patients with AF. No previously published economic evaluations of dabigatran for preventing stroke in AF patients were identified by the manufacturer searches.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Electronic databases (EMBASE, MEDLINE, MEDLINE&amp;reg; In-process, National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database [NHS EED], EconLIT) were examined from 1990 up to the 5th July 2010. The search strategies used for each database are shown in the MS. In addition to the literature databases, conference proceedings from International Society on Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) Annual International Meeting 2008 and 2009, and ISPOR Annual European Congress 2008 and 2009 were hand searched. Table 65 of the MS summarises the eligibility criteria used to select possibly relevant studies. The literature search retrieved 1,251 studies.

This decision seems appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Effectiveness Evidence Submitted&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The manufacturer's submission (MS) included two generally well-conducted systematic reviews: the first of dabigatran trials in the relevant indication, and the second of all potentially relevant pharmacological interventions for the prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). The ERG found no relevant studies that were not discussed in the submission.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the review of trials of dabigatran in the relevant indication the manufacturer identified three trials that directly compared dabigatran with warfarin: RE-LY, PETRO and 1160.49. The MS appropriately concentrated on the results of the RE-LY trial. The RE-LY trial was a good quality trial with blinded doses of dabigatran and an open-label dose warfarin arm. The other two trials were smaller phase II dose-finding studies with safety as the primary objective. The RE-LY trial was designed to demonstrate the non-inferiority of dabigatran compared to warfarin. This was appropriate given the well established efficacy of warfarin. Non-inferiority trials have limitations, particularly in relation to the establishment of the non-inferiority margin and the population on which to base analyses. However, the ERG feel that the manufacturer took adequate measures to reduce the impact of the potential biases associated with these limitations by using two margins of non-inferiority (1.46 and 1.38) and by analysing the results for both the intention to treat (ITT) and per protocol populations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The software chosen to run the mixed treatment comparison (MTC) had some limitations: the inability to include trials with zero counts and the use of a fixed effect model that produced narrower confidence intervals which may not have reflected the heterogeneity across the trials. In addition, adjustment was made for only a single covariate in the analysis, and no justification as to the choice of that covariate over another that showed significant impact on the results of four major outcomes was given. The impact of the introduction of a fourth arm to the RE-LY trial into the MTC (and potentially double counting a large number of patients) on the relative effect of dabigatran, not only compared to dose-adjusted vitamin K antagonist (VKA), but also compared to aspirin monotherapy and aspirin plus clopidogrel, is uncertain. The importance of the MTC in the manufacturer's submission was limited: only the comparison with aspirin and aspirin plus clopidogrel were utilised in the economic model's base-case; the primary comparator in clinical practice for dabigatran is warfarin. It is worth noting that in the economic section of the submission, the manufacturer defines two 'dabigatran sequences' that fed into the model: neither of these were the dabigatran sequence arm that was created for the MTC.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See Section 4 of the ERG report (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) for more information on clinical effectiveness analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost-effectiveness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Natural History&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A Markov model was employed to follow AF patients through the natural course of the disease. The manufacturer chose a Markov model for three reasons: (1) it allows for the representation and transition between health states relevant to the condition; (2) it is an approach used in the economic evaluation literature for the modelling of AF; and (3) usability and accessibility of Markov models. A simplified model diagram is presented in Figure 3 of the ERG report (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are 23 possible health states: 14 permanently active, 8 temporary states for patients who have discontinued therapy during one cycle due to extracranial haemorrhage (ECH), and the final state, death. Table 23 of the ERG report (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) describes how the events have been modelled to influence the transition of the patients between health states.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The model estimates costs and outcomes over the lifetime of the patient's cohort (up to 100 years). The outcomes considered are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The clinical events included in the model (ischaemic stroke, intracranial haemorrhage [ICH], haemorrhagic stroke, ECH, systemic embolism [SE], transient ischaemic attack [TIA], and acute myocardial infarction [MI]) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Quality of life (as quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Life years accrued &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All clinical outcomes are associated with acute costs and disutility. Further longer-term costs and disutility beyond the acute stage are only associated with ischaemic stroke, haemorrhagic stroke and ICH.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Markov cycle length in the model is 3 months and only one event per cycle is permitted. The manufacturer provided three reasons for this decision. First, 3 months should reflect the typical duration of temporary drug discontinuation due to ECH. Second, the likelihood of patients experiencing more than one major event during 3 months is claimed to be low. Third, disability and mortality due to stroke are suggested to plateau at around 3 months.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model Validation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;According to the MS, the economic model was validated in three distinct levels:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Revision and approval by key opinion leaders &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Validation of the mathematical relations and numerical inputs used by a modeller not involved in the construction of the model &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Substantiation of face validity &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The ERG was unable to validate all aspects of the manufacturer's model. The results of the model were run using a visual basic macro. In calculating the results the model ran a Markov trace for each CHADS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; score and by stroke history, but then cleared the results of each trace before calculating the next. This made it difficult to see how changes in the model affected different patient groups. It also made the model very slow to run. To calculate a single probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) result required 10 hours computation time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See Sections 5 and 6 of the ERG report (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) for more information on methods of cost-effectiveness analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="112" OrdBy="440" ID="413" Name="Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations" Type="picklist-choice"><FieldValue Value="Expert Consensus" /></Field><Field FieldID="145" OrdBy="445" ID="414" Name="Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Considerations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Technology appraisal recommendations are based on a review of clinical and economic evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technology Appraisal Process&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) invites 'consultee' and 'commentator' organisations to take part in the appraisal process. Consultee organisations include national groups representing patients and carers, the bodies representing health professionals, and the manufacturers of the technology under review. Consultees are invited to submit evidence during the appraisal and to comment on the appraisal documents.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Commentator organisations include manufacturers of the products with which the technology is being compared, the National Health Service (NHS) Quality Improvement Scotland and research groups working in the area. They can comment on the evidence and other documents but are not asked to submit evidence themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;NICE then commissions an independent academic centre to review published evidence on the technology and prepare an 'assessment report'. Consultees and commentators are invited to comment on the report. The assessment report and the comments on it are then drawn together in a document called the evaluation report.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An independent Appraisal Committee then considers the evaluation report. It holds a meeting where it hears direct, spoken evidence from nominated clinical experts, patients and carers. The Committee uses all the evidence to make its first recommendations, in a document called the 'appraisal consultation document' (ACD). NICE sends all the consultees and commentators a copy of this document and posts it on the NICE website. Further comments are invited from everyone taking part.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the Committee meets again it considers any comments submitted on the ACD; then it prepares its final recommendations in a document called the 'final appraisal determination' (FAD). This is submitted to NICE for approval.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Consultees have a chance to appeal against the final recommendations in the FAD. If there are no appeals, the final recommendations become the basis of the guidance that NICE issues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who Is on the Appraisal Committee?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;NICE technology appraisal recommendations are prepared by an independent committee. This includes health professionals working in the NHS and people who are familiar with the issues affecting patients and carers. Although the Appraisal Committee seeks the views of organisations representing health professionals, patients, carers, manufacturers and government, its advice is independent of any vested interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="146" OrdBy="450" ID="415" Name="Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not applicable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="148" OrdBy="460" ID="417" Name="Cost Analysis" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The manufacturer's economic evaluation was based on a cost&amp;ndash;utility analysis designed to compare the costs and outcomes of dabigatran with treatments used in the UK (warfarin, aspirin and aspirin plus clopidogrel). The manufacturer developed a Markov model that used three levels of disability (independent, moderate and severe) and death to define health states.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The manufacturer presented two economic models: a single-dose model and a sequential regimen model. In the single-dose model, the cohort with atrial fibrillation received either 110 mg twice daily or 150 mg twice daily throughout their treatment. In the sequential regimen model, the cohort was divided by age and modelled separately. The model for people younger than 80 years assumed that treatment began with dabigatran 150 mg twice daily, and switched to dabigatran 110 mg twice daily when the age of 80 years was reached. The model for people aged 80 years or older at baseline assumed a dose of dabigatran 110 mg twice daily throughout. Therefore, the sequential regimen model resulted in two sets of outputs: a sequential regimen model for people starting treatment younger than 80 years (incorporating a life-time horizon including the switch to 110 mg twice daily at 80 years) and a sequential regimen model for those starting treatment at 80 years or older.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The manufacturer reported pairwise cost-effectiveness results for dabigatran compared with warfarin. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for the dabigatran sequential regimen in which people started treatment when younger than 80 years and continued for the rest of their lives, and the sequential regimen in which people started treatment when older than 80 years were &amp;pound;7314 and &amp;pound;7873 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained respectively, compared with warfarin. The ICERs for dabigatran 150 mg and 110 mg twice daily compared with warfarin were &amp;pound;6264 and &amp;pound;18,691 per QALY gained respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Evidence Review Group (ERG) commented that the RE-LY trial was of good quality and that the manufacturer appropriately concentrated on the results from this trial. The ERG highlighted the limitations of non-inferiority trials, such as establishing the non-inferiority margin and the population on which to base analyses. Overall, the ERG felt that adequate measures were taken by the manufacturer to reduce the impact of potential bias associated with non-inferiority trials.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The ERG carried out exploratory cost-effectiveness analyses by subgroups according to international normalised ratio (INR) control with warfarin. The ICER for dabigatran 150 mg twice daily compared with warfarin in people with perfect INR control (that is, in target INR range 100% of the time for the entire duration of treatment) was &amp;pound;60,895 per QALY gained. Dabigatran 110 mg twice daily was dominated by warfarin because it was associated with greater costs but lower health benefits. The group of people with poor INR control was also evaluated by the ERG. The ICER for dabigatran 150 mg twice daily compared with warfarin for people with an INR below 2 was &amp;pound;740 per QALY gained. For people with an INR above 3, warfarin was dominated by dabigatran 150 mg twice daily. The ERG did not include pairwise cost-effectiveness results for dabigatran in the sequential regimen compared with warfarin. The ERG concluded that INR control is a key parameter in the economic evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary of Appraisal Committee's Key Conclusions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Availability and Nature of Evidence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Committee agreed with the ERG that the general approach taken by the manufacturer to estimate the lifetime cost-effectiveness of dabigatran was appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Uncertainties Around and Plausibility of Assumptions and Inputs in the Economic Model&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Committee concluded that the sequence of dabigatran 150 mg twice daily followed by dabigatran 110 mg twice daily once people reach 80 years would be the only regimen appropriate for the assessment of the cost-effectiveness of dabigatran relative to warfarin in the whole eligible UK population.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Committee was aware that there was uncertainty around INR monitoring costs, which cohort most realistically reflected the population of people with atrial fibrillation in the UK, and whether disability and mortality were independent of the treatment received.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What Are the Key Drivers of Cost-effectiveness?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Committee noted the ERG's comments that the cost-effectiveness of dabigatran compared with warfarin varied substantially according to level of INR control in those already being treated with warfarin.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Most Likely Cost-Effectiveness Estimate (Given as an ICER)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Committee noted that the ERG's analysis, which included all of the requested assumptions, an INR monitoring cost, and the correct values for ischaemic stroke and disability rates increased the manufacturer's base-case ICER to &amp;pound;18,900 per QALY gained for the sequential regimen in people starting younger than 80 years, compared with warfarin. The Committee concluded that the most plausible ICERs for the whole population eligible for dabigatran were within the range normally considered a cost-effective use of National Health Service (NHS) resources, being less than &amp;pound;20,000 per QALY gained.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See Sections 3 and 4 of the original guideline document for details of the economic analysis provided by the manufacturer, the Evidence Review Group comments, and the Appraisal Committee considerations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="104" OrdBy="465" ID="418" Name="Method of Guideline Validation" Type="picklist-choice"><FieldValue Value="External Peer Review" /></Field><Field FieldID="130" OrdBy="470" ID="419" Name="Description of Method of Guideline Validation" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consultee organisations from the following groups were invited to comment on the draft scope, Assessment Report and the Appraisal Consultation Document (ACD) and were provided with the opportunity to appeal against the Final Appraisal Determination.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Manufacturer/sponsors &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Professional/specialist and patient/carer groups &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Commentator organisations (without the right of appeal) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition, individuals selected from clinical expert and patient advocate nominations from the professional/specialist and patient/carer groups were also invited to comment on the ACD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field></Section><Section SecID="420" OrdBy="500" Name="Recommendations"><Field FieldID="151" OrdBy="505" ID="421" Name="Major Recommendations" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dabigatran etexilate is recommended as an option for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism within its licensed indication, that is, in people with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation with one or more of the following risk factors:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Previous stroke, transient ischaemic attack or systemic embolism &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Left ventricular ejection fraction below 40% &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Symptomatic heart failure of New York Heart Association (NYHA) class 2 or above &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Age 75 years or older &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Age 65 years or older with one of the following: diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease or hypertension. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The decision about whether to start treatment with dabigatran etexilate should be made after an informed discussion between the clinician and the person about the risks and benefits of dabigatran etexilate compared with warfarin.
