A subsequent search of the MEDLINE, CINAHL, and EMBASE databases, for articles published from January 1, 1995 to February 28, 2001, was conducted using the following search terms and keywords: &quot;psychogeriatric assessment,&quot; &quot;geriatric assessment,&quot; &quot;geriatric mental health,&quot; &quot;assessment,&quot; &quot;mental health assessment,&quot; &quot;depression,&quot; &quot;delirium,&quot; &quot;dementia(s),&quot; &quot;practice guidelines,&quot; &quot;practice guideline,&quot; &quot;clinical practice guideline,&quot; &quot;clinical practice guidelines,&quot; &quot;standards,&quot; &quot;consensus statement(s),&quot; &quot;consensus,&quot; &quot;evidence based guidelines,&quot; and &quot;best practice guidelines&quot; to a limit of age 65+. In addition, a search of the Cochrane Library database for systematic reviews was conducted using the above search terms.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A metacrawler search engine (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.metacrawler.com/&quot; title=&quot;Metacrawler Web site&quot;&gt;www.metacrawler.com&lt;/a&gt;), plus other available information provided by the project team, was used to create a list of 42 Web sites known for publishing or storing clinical practice guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One individual searched each of these sites. The presence or absence of guidelines was noted for each site searched&amp;mdash;at times it was indicated that the website did not house a guideline, but redirected to another Web site or source for guideline retrieval. A full version of the document was retrieved for all guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Panel members were asked to review personal archives to identify guidelines not previously found through the above search strategy. In a rare instance, a guideline was identified by panel members and not found through the database or Internet search. These were guidelines that were developed by local groups and had not been published to date.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The search method described above revealed twenty guidelines, several systematic reviews, and numerous articles related to geriatric mental health assessment and management. The final step in determining whether the clinical practice guideline would be critically appraised was to apply the following criteria:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Guideline was in English, international in scope &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Guideline was dated no earlier than 1996 &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Guideline was strictly about the topic areas (delirium, dementia, depression) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Guideline was evidence-based (e.g., contained references, description of evidence, sources of evidence) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Guideline was available and accessible for retrieval &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ten guidelines were deemed suitable for critical review using the Cluzeau et al. Appraisal Instrument for Clinical Guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2010 Supplement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Literature Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One individual searched an established list of websites for guidelines and other relevant content. The list was compiled based on existing knowledge of evidence-based practice websites and recommendations from the literature.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Members of the panel critically appraised 17 national and international guidelines, published since 2003, using the &quot;Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation&quot; instrument (The AGREE Collaboration, 2001). From this review, eight guidelines were identified to inform the review processes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Concurrent with the review of existing guidelines, a search for recent literature relevant to the scope of the guideline was conducted with guidance from the Team Leader. A search of electronic databases (Medline, CINAHL and EMBASE) was conducted by a health sciences librarian. A Research Assistant completed the inclusion/exclusion review, quality appraisal and data extraction of the retrieved studies, and prepared a summary of the literature findings. The comprehensive data tables and reference list were provided to all panel members.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A summary of the evidence review is provided in the Review Process Flow Chart in the original guideline supplement document.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="136" OrdBy="415" ID="408" Name="Number of Source Documents" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;November 2003 Guideline&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Following the appraisal process, the guideline development panel identified seven guidelines and related updates to develop the recommendations cited in the guideline.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2010 Supplement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The literature search yielded 2614 abstracts and 17 guidelines; 158 studies and 8 guidelines were included and retrieved for review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="115" OrdBy="420" ID="409" Name="Methods Used to Assess the Quality and Strength of the Evidence" Type="picklist-choice"><FieldValue Value="Weighting According to a Rating Scheme (Scheme Given)" /></Field><Field FieldID="149" OrdBy="425" ID="410" Name="Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strength of Evidence A&lt;/strong&gt;: Requires at least two randomized controlled trials as part of the body of literature of overall quality and consistency addressing the specific recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strength of Evidence B&lt;/strong&gt;: Requires availability of well conducted clinical studies, but no randomized controlled trials on the topic of recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strength of Evidence C&lt;/strong&gt;: Requires evidence from expert committee reports or opinions and/or clinical experience of respected authorities.

At the onset the panel discussed and came to a consensus on the scope of the best practice guideline.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A critique of systematic review articles and pertinent literature was conducted to update the existing guidelines.

In order to meet this commitment, a monitoring and revision process has been established for each guideline.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A panel of nurses was assembled for this review, comprised of members from the original development panel as well as other recommended individuals with particular expertise in this practice area. A structured evidence review based on the scope of the original guideline and supported by four clinical questions was conducted to capture the relevant literature and guidelines published since the publication of the original guideline in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Initial findings regarding the impact of the current evidence, based on the original recommendations, were summarized and circulated to the review panel. The revision panel members were given a mandate to review the original guideline in light of the new evidence, specifically to ensure the validity, appropriateness and safety of the guideline recommendations as published in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In October 2009, the panel was convened to achieve consensus on the need to revise the existing set of recommendations.

External stakeholders were provided with specific questions for comment, as well as the opportunity to give overall feedback and general impressions. The results were compiled and reviewed by the development panel; discussion and consensus resulted in revisions to the draft document prior to pilot testing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A pilot implementation practice setting was identified through a Request for Proposal (RFP) process. Practice settings in Ontario were asked to submit a proposal if they were interested in pilot testing the recommendations of the guideline. These proposals were then subjected to a review process, from which a successful practice setting was identified. A nine-month pilot implementation was undertaken to test and evaluate the recommendations in three hospitals in Toronto, Ontario. The development panel reconvened after the pilot implementation in order to review the experiences of the pilot sites, consider the evaluation results, and review any new literature published since the initial development phase.

Guidelines should not be applied in a &quot;cookbook&quot; fashion but used as a tool to assist in decision making for individualized client care, as well as ensuring that appropriate structures and supports are in place to provide the best possible care. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Nurses, other healthcare professionals and administrators who are leading and facilitating practice changes will find this document valuable for the development of policies, procedures, protocols, educational programs, assessment and documentation tools. It is recommended that the nursing best practice guidelines be used as a resource tool. It is not necessary, nor practical that every nurse have a copy of the entire guideline. Nurses providing direct client care will benefit from reviewing the recommendations, the evidence in support of the recommendations and the process that was used to develop the guidelines. However, it is highly recommended that practice settings/environments adapt these guidelines in formats that would be user-friendly for daily use. This guideline has some suggested formats for such local adaptation and tailoring. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;These best practice guidelines are related only to nursing practice and not intended to take into account fiscal efficiencies.

The Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO), through a panel of nurses, researchers, and administrators, has developed a &lt;em&gt;Toolkit: Implementation of Clinical Practice Guidelines&lt;/em&gt; based on available evidence, theoretical perspectives, and consensus. The Toolkit is recommended for guiding the implementation of any clinical practice guideline in a healthcare organization.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Toolkit provides step-by-step directions to individuals and groups involved in planning, coordinating, and facilitating guideline implementation. Specifically, the Toolkit addresses the following key steps:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Identifying a well-developed, evidence-based clinical practice guideline &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Identification, assessment, and engagement of stakeholders &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Assessment of environmental readiness for guideline implementation &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Identifying and planning evidence-based implementation strategies &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Planning and implementing an evaluation &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Identifying and securing required resources for implementation and evaluation &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Implementing practice guidelines that result in successful practice changes and positive clinical impact is a complex undertaking. The Toolkit is one key resource for managing this process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluation and Monitoring&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Organizations implementing the recommendations in this nursing best practice guideline are advised to consider how the implementation and its impact will be monitored and evaluated. A table in the original guideline document, based on the framework outlined in the RNAO Toolkit: Implementation of Clinical Practice Guidelines, illustrates some suggested indicators for monitoring and evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implementation Tips&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This best practice guideline was pilot tested at three teaching hospitals, in seven clinical settings, in Toronto, Ontario with an in-patient population. The lessons learned/results of the pilot may be unique to the three organizations and not generalizable to a public health, community care or general hospital setting. However, there were many strategies that the pilot sites found helpful during the implementation, and those who are interested in implementing this guideline may consider these strategies or implementation tips. A summary of these strategies follows:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Have a dedicated person such as a clinical resource nurse who will provide support, clinical expertise and leadership. The individual should also have good interpersonal, facilitation and project management skills. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Establishment of a steering committee comprising of key stakeholders and members committed to leading the initiative. A work plan was developed as a means of keeping track of activities, responsibilities and timelines. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Provide educational sessions and ongoing support for implementation. At the pilot sites, a core education session ranging from 2.0 to 3.5 hours in length was developed by a steering committee. The steering committee reviewed the standardized assessment tools in the RNAO best practice guideline and selected the ones to be used by the nurses during the pilot. The education session consisted of a Power Point presentation, facilitator's guide, handouts, case studies and a game to review the content material. The content of the education session drew on the recommendations contained in this guideline. Binders, posters and pocket cards listing the signs and symptoms of delirium, dementia and depression were available as ongoing reminders of the training. The steering committee also developed a set of &quot;trigger&quot; questions that were added to the initial client assessment form to help the nurses maintain &quot;a high index of suspicion&quot; for the conditions. The pilot sites found the questions helpful in identifying triggers for further assessment. The trigger questions used by the pilot sites are as follows:&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;ol style=&quot;list-style-type: lower-alpha;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;li&gt;Any acute changes in behavioural or functional status including fluctuation throughout the day? &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;li&gt;Is the client oriented to person, place or time? &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;li&gt;Are the client's thoughts organized and coherent? &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;li&gt;Impression of the client's memory? &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;li&gt;Any depressed mood, thoughts of death, suicidal ideation? &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;li&gt;Is the client able to attend to the questions? &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/ol&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Samples of other implementation tools developed by the pilot sites can be found at the RNAO website, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rnao.org/bestpractices&quot; title=&quot;RNAO Web site&quot;&gt;www.rnao.org/bestpractices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Organizational support, such as having the structures in place to facilitate the implementation. For examples, hiring of replacement staff so participants would not be distracted by concerns about work and having an organizational philosophy that reflects the value of best practices through policies and procedures and documentation tools. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Teamwork, collaborative assessment and treatment planning with the client and family and through interdisciplinary work are beneficial. It is essential to be cognizant of and to tap the resources that are available in the community. An example would be linking and developing partnerships with regional geriatric programs for referral process. The RNAO's Advanced/Clinical Practice Fellowship (ACPF) Project is another way that registered nurses may apply for a fellowship and have an opportunity to work with a mentor who has clinical expertise in delirium, dementia and depression. With the ACPF, the nurse fellow will also have the opportunity to learn more about new resources. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the tips mentioned above, the RNAO has developed resources that are available on the website. A toolkit for implementing guidelines can be helpful if used appropriately. A brief description about this toolkit can be found in Appendix P in the original guideline document.
