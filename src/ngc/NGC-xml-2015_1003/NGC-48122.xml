Recommendations contained in the physician letter were based largely on the 2005 Canadian Medical Association guidelines on follow-up after treatment for breast cancer, as well as other available guidelines. Subsequently, the Alberta Provincial Breast Tumour Team agreed to develop a formal consensus guideline, with updated recommendations based on more recent evidence from the literature. After a review of existing guidelines, consensus recommendations were agreed upon.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Formulating Recommendations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The working group members formulated the guideline recommendations based on the evidence synthesized by the Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist during the planning process, blended with expert clinical interpretation of the evidence.

Similar to the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) methodology for formulating guideline recommendations, the Guideline Utilization Resource Unit (GURU) does not use formal rating schemes for describing the strength of the recommendations, but rather describes, in conventional and explicit language, the type and quality of the research and existing guidelines that were taken into consideration when formulating the recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="146" OrdBy="450" ID="415" Name="Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not applicable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="148" OrdBy="460" ID="417" Name="Cost Analysis" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;As compared to physician-led follow-up, nurse-led follow-up has demonstrated high patient satisfaction, no differences in terms of time to recurrence or death, and greater cost-effectiveness. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;A cost analysis that included 472 breast cancer patients without distant metastasis after primary treatment and compared four strategies (e.g., three versus six months and routine versus clinical examinations) showed, after a mean follow-up of 4.2 years, that there was no difference in disease-free or overall survival, regardless of strategy.

This step ensures that those intended to use the guideline have the opportunity to review the document and identify potential difficulties for implementation before the guideline is finalized. Depending on the size of the document, and the number of people it is sent to for review, a deadline of one to two weeks will usually be given to submit any feedback. Ideally, this review will occur prior to the annual Provincial Tumour Team meeting, and a discussion of the proposed edits will take place at the meeting. The working group members will then make final revisions to the document based on the received feedback, as appropriate.

Should the physician have any specific questions, one of the oncologists in radiation oncology or medical oncology will be available to discuss the patient. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential complications from treatment&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;General Considerations for All Patients&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;    &lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;li&gt;For any patient with a history of previous breast cancer, the use of exogenous estrogens (such as oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy) is generally contraindicated. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;        &lt;li&gt;Raloxifene is not recommended for treatment of osteoporosis in patients with a previous breast cancer diagnosis while on adjuvant endocrine therapy (e.g., tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors). &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Endocrine Therapy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;    &lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;li&gt;Adherence to adjuvant endocrine therapy should be assessed and encouraged. &lt;em&gt;The referring physician may write the prescription for the patient, to be dispensed by the cancer centre pharmacy or fax the prescription the cancer center for it to be mailed to the patient.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;        &lt;li&gt;Patients receiving tamoxifen are at a slightly increased risk of deep vein thrombosis, strokes, and cataracts; investigations should be performed, as per signs and symptoms (e.g., sudden swelling or pain in an arm or leg, shortness of breath, visual changes, etc.).&#xA;        &lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xA;            &lt;li&gt;More common side effects of tamoxifen include hot flashes and vaginal discharge. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;            &lt;li&gt;In patients with an intact uterus, monitoring for endometrial cancer should include a gynecologic assessment, in addition to clinical examination. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;            &lt;li&gt;Patients experiencing abnormal vaginal bleeding should be referred to a gynecologist. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;        &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;        &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;        &lt;li&gt;Patients receiving aromatase inhibitors (i.e., anastrozole, exemestane, letrozole) may be at increased risk of joint pain and joint stiffness (especially among those with history of taxane use), bone pain, hot flashes, feeling tired, muscle pain, and insomnia.&#xA;        &lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xA;            &lt;li&gt;Patients at risk for developing osteopenia and/or osteoporosis should have a baseline and annual bone density assessment (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry [DEXA] scan) performed. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;            &lt;li&gt;Osteoporosis should be treated according to the 2010 Canadian Osteoporosis Guidelines (Papaioannou et al., 2010). &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;            &lt;li&gt;Patients at risk of fracture are recommended to:&#xA;            &lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xA;                &lt;li&gt;Perform regular weight-bearing, balance and strengthening exercises &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;                &lt;li&gt;Practice smoking cessation &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;                &lt;li&gt;Optimize total calcium (dietary and supplements): 1000&amp;ndash;1200 mg per day if postmenopausal (preferably from dietary/food sources) &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;                &lt;li&gt;Optimize total vitamin D (supplements): vitamin D: 1000&amp;ndash;2000 international units (IU) per day (Papaioannou et al., 2010) &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;            &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;            &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;            &lt;li&gt;Raloxifene (Evista&amp;reg;) should not be prescribed for osteoporosis treatment in patients with a previous breast cancer diagnosis. In cases where osteopenia/osteoporosis treatment is indicated, consideration for an alternate bone targeted agent (e.g., bisphosphonate or RANK-ligand inhibitor) should be used instead. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;        &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;        &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fatigue&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;    &lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;li&gt;Long-term follow-up care is important for patients after cancer therapy. Fatigue may be caused by anemia, depression, anxiety, pain, dehydration, nutritional deficiencies, sedating medications, and therapies that may have poorly tolerated side effects (National Cancer Institute, 2011). A history of symptoms should be taken to rule out physical causes. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;        &lt;li&gt;Psychostimulant drugs, treatment for anemia, exercise, cognitive behavior therapy, activity and rest, or patient education may help patients alleviate the symptoms of fatigue. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Peripheral Neuropathy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;    &lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;li&gt;Chemotherapy may cause damage to nerves, resulting in neuropathy. Symptoms vary depending on the type of chemotherapy and whether sensory or motor nerves are involved, but can include paresthesias, numbness, imbalance, pain, and weakness of muscles in the hands and feet (Emery et al., 2001; Reyes-Gibby et al., 2009). &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;        &lt;li&gt;Work-up should include history and physical exam, as well as neurological exam (e.g., reflexes, muscle strength and tone, sensations, posture, and coordination). Electromyography, nerve biopsy, and computed tomography (CT) or MRI imaging may be indicated (Mayo Clinic, &quot;Diseases,&quot; 2011). &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;        &lt;li&gt;Treatments may include pain relievers (i.e., acetaminophen, ibuprofen, opiates), anti-seizure drugs (i.e., gabapentin, topiramate, pregabalin, carbamazepine, phenytoin), lidocaine (patch), antidepressants (i.e., amitriptyline, nortriptyline) or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (Mayo Clinic, &quot;Diseases,&quot; 2011). &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;        &lt;li&gt;Alternative techniques, such as acupuncture, capsaicin cream, alpha-lipoic acid, and biofeedback have been used to manage the symptoms of peripheral neuropathy; however, these methods have not been tested rigorously. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lymphedema&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;    &lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;li&gt;Lymphedema or swelling of the arm is a possible complication of breast cancer treatment. It occurs more frequently with mastectomy, axillary lymph node dissection, and radiation therapy. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;        &lt;li&gt;Treatments may include the following:&#xA;        &lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xA;            &lt;li&gt;Manual lymphatic drainage therapy: a technique that uses massage to move lymph fluid out of the affected limb to functioning lymph nodes for drainage; this technique may be contraindicated in individuals with a skin infection, active cancer, blood clots, and congestive heart failure, as well as on areas of the body that have received radiotherapy (Mayo Clinic, &quot;Lymphedema,&quot; 2011). &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;            &lt;li&gt;Physical therapy or exercise: a technique that uses light muscle contractions of the affected limb to facilitate the drainage of lymph fluid; strenuous exercises should be avoided. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;            &lt;li&gt;Compression therapy: a technique that uses garments, bandages, or gradient pumps to compress the affected limb and move lymph fluid towards the torso (Mayo Clinic, &quot;Lymphedema,&quot; 2011). Compression therapy may be combined with manual lymphatic drainage and/or physical therapy. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;            &lt;li&gt;Surgery: several procedures, such as lymphatic venous anastomosis, vascularized lymph node transfer, and lymphatic liposuction can be performed to reconstruct the lymphatic vessels or remove lymphedematous tissue. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;            &lt;li&gt;Low level laser therapy (LLLT): infra-red light is used to displace nitric oxide from the cells and restore the production of cellular energy (adenosine triphosphate [ATP]), allowing tissue to repair; LLLT has been approved by Health Canada, but is still considered experimental. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;        &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;        &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;        &lt;li&gt;Programs and services are available in Calgary and Edmonton:&#xA;        &lt;ul&gt;&#xA;            &lt;li&gt;Calgary: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.albertahealthservices.ca/services.asp?pid=service&amp;amp;rid=1026510&quot; title=&quot;Alberta Health Services Web site&quot;&gt;www.albertahealthservices.ca/services.asp?pid=service&amp;amp;rid=1026510&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;            &lt;li&gt;Edmonton: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lymphovenous-canada.ca/lymphedemaclinics.htm&quot; title=&quot;Lymphovenous Canada  Web site&quot;&gt;www.lymphovenous-canada.ca/lymphedemaclinics.htm&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;        &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;        &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cardiac Dysfunction&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;    &lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;li&gt;Cardiac dysfunction can occur in some patients undergoing treatment with anthracycline-based chemotherapy or trastuzumab. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;        &lt;li&gt;If patient is symptomatic or has clinical signs, evaluate further with electrocardiogram (ECG) and multigated acquisition scan (MUGA) or echocardiogram and refer to cardiology if significant abnormalities are noted. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Acute Leukemia/Myelodysplasia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;    &lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;li&gt;In some patients undergoing treatment with chemotherapy, perform a complete blood count (CBC) + differential (peripheral blood smear); refer to hematology if significant persistent cytopenias or blast cells are noted. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Support Resources &amp;amp; Recommendations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;    &lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;li&gt;Patients may experience fear of recurrence, stress over financial, family, or work issues, depression and anxiety, anger over their experience with cancer, or loneliness after support from caregivers is no longer needed. Patients should be assessed for emotional health issues (Waldemar, 2007). Patients often struggle with emotional and psychological concerns post-treatment. Post-treatment adjustment should therefore be assessed, and if problems are identified, treatment and/or referral to an appropriately trained professional should be ensured. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;        &lt;li&gt;General support resources:&#xA;        &lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xA;            &lt;li&gt;CancerBridges &amp;ndash; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cancerbridges.ca&quot; title=&quot;Cancer Bridges Canada Web site&quot;&gt;www.cancerbridges.ca&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;            &lt;li&gt;Canadian Cancer Society &amp;ndash; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cancer.ca&quot; title=&quot;Canadian Cancer Soceity Web site&quot;&gt;http://www.cancer.ca&lt;/a&gt; or 1-888-939-3333. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;            &lt;li&gt;Wellspring &amp;ndash; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wellspring.ca&quot; title=&quot;Wellspring Canada Web site&quot;&gt;www.wellspring.ca&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;            &lt;li&gt;Alberta Health Services &amp;ndash; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.albertahealthservices.ca&quot; title=&quot;Alberta Health Services Web site&quot;&gt;http://www.albertahealthservices.ca&lt;/a&gt;.&#xA;            &lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xA;                &lt;li&gt;Click: &lt;em&gt;Health Information &amp;gt; Diseases &amp;amp; Conditions &amp;gt; Cancer &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;            &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;            &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;            &lt;li&gt;American Society for Clinical Oncology (patient site): &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cancer.net&quot; title=&quot;ASCO Web site&quot;&gt;http://www.cancer.net&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;        &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;        &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;        &lt;li&gt;Counseling and support:&#xA;        &lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xA;            &lt;li&gt;Psychosocial support should be encouraged and facilitated, as needed.

Sexual functioning should be discussed with the patient at follow-up visits.&#xA;        &lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xA;            &lt;li&gt;Menopause symptoms: Endocrine therapies commonly cause menopausal symptoms and chemotherapy may lead to early menopause. Hot flashes which interfere with sleep and daily function can be managed with non-hormone therapies (e.g., venlafaxine or gabapentin). Vaginal dryness can be managed with a dual purpose vaginal moisturizer and lubricant (e.g., Replens&amp;reg;). If non-hormonal therapies do not help, vaginal estrogen (Estring&amp;reg;, Vagifem&amp;reg;) can be considered. Exogenous hormonal therapy is generally contraindicated. For refractory vaginal symptoms, referral to gynecology should be considered. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;            &lt;li&gt;Self-image: For some women, breasts are an important part of their self-image. If they are concerned about how a lumpectomy or mastectomy has changed their body, they may be interested in more information regarding a breast prosthesis or breast reconstruction. Psychological counseling can also be helpful for improving body image satisfaction, addressing relationship concerns and reducing sexual dysfunction. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;        &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;        &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;        &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Family Planning&lt;/span&gt;: Pregnancy while on endocrine therapy is contraindicated. The absence of regular menses does not equate to menopause in all cases. Non-hormonal contraception is generally recommended. There is an increased risk of sub-fertility/infertility and premature menopause in women who have had previous chemotherapy. There is no evidence that future pregnancy adversely affects recurrence or survival; there is no medical reason to terminate a pregnancy in absence of evidence of relapse. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="138" OrdBy="515" ID="423" Name="Clinical Algorithm(s)" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;None provided&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field></Section><Section SecID="424" OrdBy="600" Name="Evidence Supporting the Recommendations"><Field FieldID="98" OrdBy="605" ID="425" Name="References Supporting the Recommendations" Type="citation"><FieldValue Value="&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;American Institute for Cancer Research.

These patients are also at risk for osteoporosis. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Chemotherapy may cause damage to nerves, resulting in neuropathy. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Lymphedema or swelling of the arm is a possible complication of breast cancer treatment. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Cardiac dysfunction can occur in some patients undergoing treatment with anthracycline-based chemotherapy or trastuzumab. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Patients often struggle with emotional and psychological concerns post-treatment. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;There is an increased risk of sub-fertility/infertility and premature menopause in women who have had previous chemotherapy. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;" /></Field></Section><Section SecID="430" OrdBy="800" Name="Contraindications"><Field FieldID="144" OrdBy="805" ID="431" Name="Contraindications" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;For any patient with a history of previous breast cancer, the use of exogenous estrogens (such as oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy) is generally contraindicated. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Manual lymphatic drainage therapy (a technique that uses massage to move lymph fluid out of the affected limb to functioning lymph nodes for drainage) may be contraindicated in individuals with a skin infection, active cancer, blood clots, and congestive heart failure, as well as on areas of the body that have received radiotherapy. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Exogenous hormonal therapy is generally contraindicated for menopause symptoms. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Pregnancy while on endocrine therapy is contraindicated. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Raloxifene (Evista&amp;reg;) should not be prescribed for osteoporosis treatment in patients with a previous breast cancer diagnosis. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;" /></Field></Section><Section SecID="432" OrdBy="900" Name="Qualifying Statements"><Field FieldID="137" OrdBy="905" ID="433" Name="Qualifying Statements" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recommendations contained in this guideline are a consensus of the Alberta Provincial Breast Tumour Team and are a synthesis of currently accepted approaches to management, derived from a review of relevant scientific literature.
