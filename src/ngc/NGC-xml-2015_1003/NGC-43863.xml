The key words and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) were developed on a Medline/PubMed platform. The same text words and the relevant alternatives to MeSH indexing terms (i.e., EmTree headings) were used for the other bibliographic databases, where applicable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Study Selection Criteria&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Criteria for including studies in the systematic review were based on the PICO structure &amp;mdash; Population, Intervention (treatment or risk factors), Comparator (against which an intervention's effectiveness is measured), and Outcomes of interest. Additional limits to the literature search included restricting the search to studies of a certain research design(s) (e.g., likely to provide unbiased or more reliable results), to a certain search period or language. In order to ensure that the selection of studies was not biased, these criteria were delineated before collating the literature.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Studies were excluded if they:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Did not meet the inclusion criteria listed &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Focused on postpartum depression (separate clinical practice guidelines for perinatal mental health &amp;ndash; &lt;em&gt;Clinical practice guidelines for depression and related disorders &amp;ndash; anxiety, bipolar disorder and puerperal psychosis &amp;ndash; in the perinatal period&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;A guideline for primary care health professionals&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ndash; were developed by &lt;em&gt;beyondblue&lt;/em&gt; with support from National Health and Medical Research Council [NHMRC]) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Focused on transient sadness or grief that occurs as a reaction to life events but does not affect sleeping patterns, appetite, or the ability to function &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Focused on management of depression within adults, without any discussion of how age influences outcomes, or subgroup analyses allowing data on young adults (19 to 24 years) to be separated from older adults (25 years old and older) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Did not state that the research was approved by an appropriate ethics committee &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Did not provide adequate data on the outcomes (e.g., in graphical format, missing information, format or type of data were unable to be used) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Were updated by the same research group on the same research question for the same patients, with no different information provided &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Could not be retrieved within the timeframe &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For many treatments of interest there was no study in the adolescent or young adult age range or if a study existed it may have been excluded due to poor methodology. The latter included idiosyncratic referral or participant characteristics, exclusion criteria that made the study hard to generalise, poorly defined measurement or measures with non-specified psychometric properties, low sample size with insufficient power to find an effect, limited details of the intervention (either active or control or both), or conclusions that were not consistent with the results or not mindful of study limitations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Studies were included if:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Depressive symptoms were measured. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The main target of the treatment was depression or preventing the development of depression. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Types of clinical depression included: major depressive disorder, dysthymia, seasonal affective disorder, depression secondary to disease or injury, adjustment disorder with depression, bipolar depression (bipolar disorder, cyclothymic disorder), melancholic (biological) or non-melancholic (not primarily biological), psychotic depression, atypical depression, and mixed depression and anxiety. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;

in terms of internal and external validity &amp;mdash; and the statistical and clinical relevance and applicability of results were determined using the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) dimensions of evidence. The evidence dimensions consider important aspects of the evidence supporting a particular intervention and include three main domains: strength of the evidence, size of the effect, and relevance of the evidence. The first domain is derived directly from the literature identified as informing a particular intervention. The last two required expert clinical input as part of their determination. See Table A3.3 in Appendix 3 in the original guideline document for definitions of each evidence dimension.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appraisal of the Evidence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The strength of the evidence was collectively measured by the three sub-domains: level, quality, and statistical precision.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The research design of each study included in the systematic review was assessed according to its place in a hierarchy. The hierarchy reflects the effectiveness of the study design to answer a particular research question. Effectiveness is based on the probability that the design of the study has reduced or eliminated the impact of bias on the results.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The designations of the levels of evidence were based on NHMRC levels of evidence and grades for recommendations for developers of guidelines (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence&quot; field). This included the designations of levels of evidence for intervention studies together with questions on prognosis (how risk factors impact outcomes) and aetiology (what are the risk factors/protective factors). Due to the volume of evidence available, the Expert Working Committee agreed to restrict the systematic review to the highest level of evidence available for each intervention/risk factor assessed in the clinical research questions (i.e., for studies on risk factors, only prospective cohort studies or systematic reviews of prospective cohort studies were included).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Critical appraisal of the studies included in this systematic review was performed to evaluate their methodological quality, according to the likelihood that bias, confounding, and/or chance had influenced the results. The NHMRC toolkit publication &lt;em&gt;How to Review the Evidence: Systematic Identification and Review of the Scientific Literature&lt;/em&gt; provides examples of critical appraisal checklists that may be used. Similar checklists were used for this systematic review, which were adapted and evaluated by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) for the assessment of systematic reviews, randomised controlled trials, cohort studies, and case&amp;ndash;control studies. These checklists have been subjected to wide consultation and evaluation, and are accompanied by detailed notes on their use. Economic evaluation studies were evaluated using the Drummond checklist, which is recommended for Cochrane systematic reviews. The SIGN checklists were chosen in preference to the ones suggested by NHMRC, as they are more comprehensive for assessing sources of bias.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Statistical Precision&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Statistical precision was determined using standard statistical principles. Small confidence intervals and p-values give an indication as to the probability that the reported effect is real. Where there were multiple statistical comparisons, the results were at risk of type 1 error (incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis) if there was not a correction to the&amp;nbsp;p-value. Post-hoc subgroup analyses may not have adequate statistical power and may also have resulted in a breaking of randomisation (selection bias) and are therefore treated as hypothesis generating, requiring further formal evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assessing Size of Effect and Relevance of Evidence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For intervention studies it is important to assess whether statistically significant differences are also clinically important. The size of the effect needs to be determined, as well as whether the 95% confidence interval includes only clinically important effects. Similarly, the outcome being measured should be appropriate and clinically relevant. Clinical and patient relevant outcomes should be used instead of surrogate outcomes, whenever possible. Inadequately validated (predictive) surrogate measures of a clinically relevant outcome should be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Effect sizes were used to provide a consistent measure of the comparative size of effect from one treatment compared to another (or no treatment). For prevention studies, Hedges' g was chosen as a method of determining effect size, as it uses a more conservative method of determining variance, which was considered more suitable than a Cohen's d, given the large proportion of studies on the prevention of depression in adolescents that are cluster randomised controlled trials. Within treatment studies, the majority of participants received individual interventions, rather than group interventions. Cohen's d was therefore considered appropriate to estimate effect sizes for treatment comparisons. Effect sizes were considered to have a small clinical impact if they were 0.2&amp;ndash;0.3, medium if they were between 0.5 and 0.6, and large if they were 0.8 or over. If raw data were presented, a difference of at least 10% between treatment groups was used as an indicator of being potentially clinically relevant.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Extraction and Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Standardised protocols and outcome definitions were used by the assessors to extract the data. Data extraction forms were developed prior to conducting the review to ensure the standardised extraction of outcome data for all study types. Evidence tables were used as a guide to summarise the extraction of data.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For intervention questions, meta-analyses of randomised and pseudo-randomised controlled trials were conducted where appropriate and tested for heterogeneity and publication bias. Data were stratified by type of depression (unipolar or bipolar) and age group (adolescents and young adults). All meta-analyses were performed using the software package Comprehensive Meta Analysis Version 2.2.048 (Biostat, 2008). Random effects models were used in preference to fixed effects models, to provide a more conservative estimate of effect size, as it was assumed that the population parameters varied between studies. Where meta-analysis could not be conducted, a narrative synthesis of the data was undertaken.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The full report of the literature review is available from the &lt;em&gt;beyondblue&lt;/em&gt; Web site (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Assessing the Body of Evidence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After each included study had been assessed according to the three dimensions of evidence and relevant data extracted and summarised, this information was used to assist in the formulation of the evidence statements, and in determining the overall grade for the included studies (the 'body of evidence') that supports the evidence statements and subsequent recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grading of the Evidence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Applying evidence in real clinical situations is not usually straightforward and thus the body of evidence supporting a recommendation is rarely entirely one grade for all-important components. The grading process was designed to allow for this mixture of components while still reflecting the overall strength of the body of evidence supporting a recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The application of a grade to an evidence statement and recommendation was based on a rating of the body of evidence. The five components considered in rating the body of evidence are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Evidence base, in terms of the number of studies, level of evidence, and quality of studies (risk of bias) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Consistency of the study results &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Potential clinical impact of the proposed recommendation &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Generalisability of the body of evidence to the target population for the Guidelines &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Applicability of the body of evidence to the Australian healthcare context &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The NHMRC Evidence Statement Form was used for each clinical question addressed in the Guidelines. Prior to completing the form, each individual study relevant to the clinical question was critically appraised and the relevant data synthesised. The form was used as the basis of discussion regarding the key components. Components were rated according to the matrix shown in the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence&quot; field. Any further notes relevant to developing the recommendation were also recorded in the space provided in the form. The synthesis of the evidence relating to each component was summarised. Any dissenting opinions or other relevant issues were recorded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="112" OrdBy="440" ID="413" Name="Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations" Type="picklist-choice"><FieldValue Value="Expert Consensus" /></Field><Field FieldID="145" OrdBy="445" ID="414" Name="Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The development of the Guidelines followed the key principles and processes outlined in the document: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/file/publications/synopses/nh56.pdf&quot; title=&quot;NHMRC Web site&quot;&gt;NHMRC Standards and Procedures for Externally Developed Guidelines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An Expert Working Committee was established in 2008 to develop the draft 2011 Guidelines. Membership included consumers, carers, and representatives from relevant health professions including psychiatrists, physicians, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health experts, general practitioners, psychologists, and school counsellors. An observer representing the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) attended two of the meetings, and was consulted on issues regarding NHMRC processes and requirements as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The recommendations in these Guidelines were developed by the Expert Working Committee based on systematic review of evidence published before the end of November 2008. Evidence that was graded A or B according to the NHMRC gradings (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence&quot; field) was formulated as recommendations. Evidence graded C or D was not used to form recommendations, as evidence of this level must be applied with caution.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Good practice points (GPPs) were developed to cover areas that had been addressed in the systematic literature review but where insufficient evidence to support a recommendation was identified, as well as areas that were beyond the scope of the systematic literature review but where practical advice is needed. The GPPs do not reflect studies that were graded C or D. Rather the GPP classification indicates guidance that, at this stage, does not meet the scientific rigour of a formal recommendation. The formulation of GPPs involved a process of:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Identifying areas where advice was required (e.g., raised by other guidelines, Committee members or through the consultation process) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Reviewing any evidence identified through the systematic literature review &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Drafting of a GPP by members with expertise specific to the area &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Refinement of the GPP by the whole Committee over several iterations until consensus was reached &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Formulating and Grading of Recommendations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Recommendations are based on the highest level of evidence available. A process developed by the NHMRC for assessing the body of evidence and formulating recommendations was used to ensure consistency in the development of evidence-based recommendations. The NHMRC Evidence Statement Form for assessing the body of evidence was used to assist with the formulation of the recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Evidence statements were developed by the assessors and refined in collaboration with the Expert Working Committee. Once the wording for the evidence statement was developed, the overall grade of the evidence statement/recommendation was determined, based on a summation of the rating for each individual component of the body of evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;NHMRC overall grades of recommendation are intended to indicate the strength of the body of evidence underpinning the recommendation. This should assist users of guidelines to make appropriate and informed clinical judgements. Grade A or B recommendations are generally based on a body of evidence that can be trusted to guide clinical practice, whereas Grades C or D recommendations must be applied carefully to individual clinical and organisational circumstances and should be interpreted with care.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Expert Working Committee decided that evidence statements graded C or D would not be used to form recommendations included in the Guidelines. Evidence statements that were graded A or B were translated into a recommendation by the Expert Working Committee (all evidence statements are listed in Table A3.5 in the original guideline document). The recommendations address the original clinical questions and were written as action statements. The wording of the recommendations reflects the strength of the body of evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implementing Recommendations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The implementation strategy for the Guidelines was considered at the time that recommendations were being formulated to identify supports required for their successful uptake. The questions in the implementation of recommendation section of the NHMRC Evidence Statement Form were used to achieve this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="146" OrdBy="450" ID="415" Name="Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definition of Grades of Recommendations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt; Body of evidence can be trusted to guide practice&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; Body of evidence can be trusted to guide practice in most situations&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt; Body of evidence provides some support for recommendation(s) but care should be taken in its application&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt; Body of evidence is weak and recommendation must be applied with caution&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p class=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;Source: &lt;em&gt;NHMRC levels of evidence and grades for recommendations for developers of guidelines&lt;/em&gt; (NHMRC 2009).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Good practice points (&lt;strong&gt;GPPs&lt;/strong&gt;) were developed to cover areas that had been addressed in the systematic literature review but where insufficient evidence to support a recommendation was identified, as well as areas that were beyond the scope of the systematic literature review but where practical advice is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="148" OrdBy="460" ID="417" Name="Cost Analysis" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Costs of Implementing the Recommendations and Good Practice Points&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Guideline recommendations for treatment of major depression in young people have two major costing implications.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The treatment of first choice is either cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT). These psychological therapies require dedicated training, supervision, and a strategy to maintain treatment fidelity over time (e.g., strategies to prevent deviation of therapist practice away from the form of therapy that has demonstrated benefit in randomised controlled trials). Accreditation and reaccreditation may be considered suitable strategies to achieve these goals.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are minimal cost implications associated with recommending the use of the medication with the strongest evidence base (fluoxetine) as this is not a new agent and both the original form and less costly alternatives are currently available. There may be cost implications associated with the advice to seek input from an expert in antidepressant therapy for young people if the response to fluoxetine and evidence-based psychotherapy is inadequate. While it is difficult to quantify on current data about the availability of telephone advice and access to private and public psychiatrists, this approach is likely to be cost-effective. In many areas this is consistent with the current model of care and is likely to be no greater than CBT/IPT training and compliance costs for evidence-based psychological therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="104" OrdBy="465" ID="418" Name="Method of Guideline Validation" Type="picklist-choice"><FieldValue Value="External Peer Review" /><FieldValue Value="Internal Peer Review" /></Field><Field FieldID="130" OrdBy="470" ID="419" Name="Description of Method of Guideline Validation" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public Consultation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The draft Guidelines were released for a 60-day public consultation, as required in the &lt;em&gt;National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Act 1992&lt;/em&gt; (as amended), so that the final Guidelines could be submitted for approval by the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the NHMRC, under Item 14A &lt;em&gt;Approval by CEO of guidelines for third parties, under the Act&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although the minimum requirement for the public consultation is 30 days, &lt;em&gt;beyondblue&lt;/em&gt; wished to provide stakeholders and the public with plenty of opportunity to make comments on and suggestions for the draft Guidelines, and so a 60-day consultation period was selected (13 March to 12 May 2010).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The draft Guidelines underwent a rigorous consultation process during which time:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Interested stakeholders, individuals, and organisations were invited to submit written comments. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;A series of national workshops for consumers and carers and for healthcare professionals, was held in capital cities and/or regional centres in each State and Territory. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The public consultation commenced by way of an advertisement in &lt;em&gt;The Weekend Australian&lt;/em&gt; of 13 March 2010 and formally ended on 12 May 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Publication Approval&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The final Guidelines were submitted to the Council of the NHMRC in late 2010.

Continuing maintenance of therapy skills is essential.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pharmacological Treatment &amp;mdash; Major Depressive Disorder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; - Prescription of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine should be considered for acute, short-term reduction of depressive symptoms in adolescents with moderate to severe major depressive disorder, where psychological therapy has not been effective, is not available or is refused, or if symptoms are severe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; - CBT may be added to/continued with SSRI therapy, to reduce the risk of suicidal thinking and improve functioning in adolescents with major depressive disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; - Tricyclic antidepressants should not be used for treating major depressive disorder in adolescents.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GPP&lt;/strong&gt; - In the absence of more substantial evidence on treating depression in young adults, it is reasonable to extrapolate from the evidence on pharmacological treatment in adolescents (see the preceding three recommendations).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GPP&lt;/strong&gt; - SSRIs are not recommended for treating young people with mild depression.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GPP&lt;/strong&gt; - Prescription of an SSRI must occur within the context of an ongoing therapeutic relationship and management plan.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GPP&lt;/strong&gt; - To enable informed consent to pharmacological treatment, young people must be given information on adverse effects (including the possibility of emergence or escalation of suicidal thinking) and the need for ongoing monitoring during treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GPP&lt;/strong&gt; - Pharmacological treatments need to be prescribed by those trained to do so, who are very familiar with the range of adverse effects and able to appropriately monitor the young person. Where necessary, expert advice should be sought before prescribing, or the young person should be referred to a mental health service or psychiatrist.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitoring&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; - Young people should be monitored for the onset of or increase in suicidal thinking following initiation of SSRIs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GPP&lt;/strong&gt; - Close monitoring of symptom severity and adverse effects is required for young people taking an SSRI, especially during the first 4 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GPP&lt;/strong&gt; - A protocol for managing suicidal thinking must be in place for every young person who is taking an SSRI, including baseline assessment and regular monitoring for suicidal thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GPP&lt;/strong&gt; - Health professionals should be aware of the risk that a manic episode may be precipitated following initiation of SSRIs. For young people with depressive episodes and a history of mania or mixed presentations, a mood stabiliser may be required.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Continuing Treatment &amp;mdash; Major Depressive Disorder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inadequate Response to Treatment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GPP&lt;/strong&gt; - If a young person does not respond to an adequate treatment dose (psychological therapy and/or pharmacological treatment) after an appropriate period of time, the diagnosis should be reviewed and consideration given to co-occurring conditions, drug or alcohol misuse, or ongoing adverse circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continuation and Maintenance Therapy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GPP&lt;/strong&gt; - While there is a small evidence base, current good clinical practice suggests continuing medication therapy for 6 months post-remission.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GPP&lt;/strong&gt; - Where SSRI medication is warranted, a combined SSRI plus CBT/IPT approach appears to provide the most effective care. If a moderate to severe depressive disorder fails to respond to combined therapy, specialist advice or a second opinion should be sought.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GPP&lt;/strong&gt; - If discontinuation of treatment is planned, consideration needs to be given to factors that may contribute to relapse and recurrence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Severe or Recurrent Depression and/or Co-occurring Conditions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GPP&lt;/strong&gt; - Complex presentations may require a longer assessment phase and multiple interventions delivered by different health professionals. Overall case management by one health professional is advisable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GPP&lt;/strong&gt; - Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be considered in rare cases, such as treating severe depression with psychotic features where other approaches have not been successful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GPP&lt;/strong&gt; - If inpatient care is required, admission should be to an environment designed for young people wherever possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Management of Bipolar Disorder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psychological Therapy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GPP&lt;/strong&gt; - Psychoeducation and psychological interventions to improve management and assist with coping skills and psychosocial functioning are valuable adjuncts to pharmacological treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pharmacological Treatment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GPP&lt;/strong&gt; - Considerations in decision-making about pharmacological treatments include past history of mania or family history of bipolar disorder, severity of symptoms, need for short-term stabilisation, previous dosage regime and adherence to treatments, and reasons for any non-adherence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GPP&lt;/strong&gt; - Serious agitation may require adjunctive medication, consistent with local prescribing protocols. If the patient is less unwell, lithium can be the initial drug of choice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GPP&lt;/strong&gt; - Short-term medication is generally required for acute mania, preferably with rapid-acting anti-mania medications.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GPP&lt;/strong&gt; - Medication used for short-term stabilisation (e.g., for agitation) should be tapered and discontinued.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GPP&lt;/strong&gt; - If symptoms are severe or the young person does not respond to treatment, combination pharmacological treatment is justified.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GPP&lt;/strong&gt; - Specialist input should be sought for the care of young women with bipolar disorder who are considering pregnancy, pregnant, or in the postpartum period.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continuing Treatment and Relapse Prevention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GPP&lt;/strong&gt; - A consistent, long-term, flexible relationship between the young person, his or her parents/carers and one health professional is ideal for outpatient care in young people whose condition has been stabilised. Young people's family members should feel comfortable contacting the health professional to report escalations of symptoms or other emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Definitions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definition of Grades of Recommendations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt; Body of evidence can be trusted to guide practice&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; Body of evidence can be trusted to guide practice in most situations&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt; Body of evidence provides some support for recommendation(s) but care should be taken in its application&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt; Body of evidence is weak and recommendation must be applied with caution&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p class=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;Source: &lt;em&gt;NHMRC levels of evidence and grades for recommendations for developers of guidelines&lt;/em&gt; (NHMRC 2009).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Good practice points (&lt;strong&gt;GPPs&lt;/strong&gt;) were developed to cover areas that had been addressed in the systematic literature review but where insufficient evidence to support a recommendation was identified, as well as areas that were beyond the scope of the systematic literature review but where practical advice is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="138" OrdBy="515" ID="423" Name="Clinical Algorithm(s)" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The original guideline document includes the following clinical algorithms:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Process of differential diagnosis &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;General responses to identified risk of suicide &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Process of assessment for depression in young people &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Practice algorithm for use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRIs) by young people &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Algorithm for managing major depressive disorder in young people &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field></Section><Section SecID="424" OrdBy="600" Name="Evidence Supporting the Recommendations"><Field FieldID="139" OrdBy="610" ID="426" Name="Type of Evidence Supporting the Recommendations" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The type of evidence is identified and graded for each recommendation (see the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field).

ADRAC has also advised that prescribers in Australia should note that the marketers of SSRIs warn, or caution against the use of SSRIs for depression in people aged less than 18 years. While not preventing their use, ADRAC advised that the use of SSRIs in young people should only occur in the context of a comprehensive management plan for the patient, which includes careful monitoring for the development of suicidal thinking or behaviours. ADRAC also noted that patients already being treated with an SSRI should not have their medication ceased abruptly. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;" /></Field></Section><Section SecID="430" OrdBy="800" Name="Contraindications"><Field FieldID="144" OrdBy="805" ID="431" Name="Contraindications" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Tricyclic antidepressants should not be used for treating major depressive disorder in adolescents. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Anticonvulsant use in pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of major birth defects, with rates being dose dependent, and highest when using valproate.

A principle of evidence-based medicine is that evidence is more robust if results have been replicated by several studies across different sites and from different research teams. Lack of evidence of effect means the summation of known research, combined in a rigorous process (e.g., a systematic literature review) found no evidence that the intervention was effective. To this end, clinical practice guidelines, including these Guidelines, may include A or B grade evidence that an intervention is not effective. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Efficacy versus effectiveness &amp;mdash; Efficacy is the extent to which a specific intervention or treatment produces a beneficial effect under ideal conditions. Effectiveness is similar, except that the intervention is used in the field, in routine circumstances and the effect is as intended for the specified population. In the context of the Australian healthcare system, these Guidelines will ideally guide the routine practice of mental health interventions with adolescents and young adults in real world settings. Care is therefore necessary, given that most evidence is generated in highly controlled settings, and studies with the most comprehensive participant exclusion criteria are often the most difficult to generalise to clinical practice settings. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Application of the recommendations &amp;mdash; The recommendations in the Guidelines usually apply to the 'average' patient and may be expected to apply to most individuals presenting with a form of depression, most of the time. Guidelines still require health professionals to tailor management to the individual, and to consider contextual factors at the time of presentation. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field></Section><Section SecID="434" OrdBy="1000" Name="Implementation of the Guideline"><Field FieldID="131" OrdBy="1010" ID="436" Name="Description of Implementation Strategy" Type="text"><FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implementation, Monitoring and Review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The dissemination processes and channels of &lt;em&gt;beyondblue&lt;/em&gt; will be used to widely disseminate the Guidelines and accompanying documents to the relevant agencies and individuals. This will include health professionals, consumers and carers, and policy makers who are involved in influencing youth mental health policy and practice. Summaries of the Guidelines and commentaries will be published in appropriate journals, and practical guidance for specific groups will be derived from the Guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The context within which the Guidelines will be implemented has changed considerably since the previous guidelines were published in 1997. As well as a surge in published studies both in Australia and internationally over the past decade, there is widespread activity at national, jurisdictional, and local levels, including national and jurisdictional policies (e.g., the Fourth National Mental Health Plan 2009&amp;ndash;2014), programs and resources developed by organisations (e.g., &lt;em&gt;beyondblue&lt;/em&gt;, headspace, Black Dog Institute) and a range of self-help, support and advocacy services, and resources at the local level. &lt;em&gt;beyondblue&lt;/em&gt; is extremely well placed to instigate and foster communication between the Guideline developers and communities of practice and interest in youth mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is likely that the situation will continue to change rapidly as research in this area keeps expanding. The intention is that these should be 'living' Guidelines, with the online version periodically updated to include higher-level evidence as it becomes available. It is anticipated that major review of the evidence will be undertaken within 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;beyondblue&lt;/em&gt; has appointed an independent evaluator to assess the usefulness and uptake of the Guidelines, and to identify changes in clinical practice as a result of the release of the Guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implementation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Implementation is seen as a key issue for the uptake and appropriate use of the Guidelines. There are clear lessons from the 1997 Guidelines and other more recent work such as the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines, including the need to provide brief summaries of information for general practitioners and consumers. The most profound change since the 1997 Guidelines is access of health information through the internet. Versions of the 2011 Guidelines will be available online. Degree of content detail will match the user group &amp;mdash; for example, complete text for the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists and the Australian Psychological Association website, concise easier access versions with treatment algorithms available through all Divisions of General Practice sites and more consumer and carer friendly documents through open access sites. The most obvious example of the latter is the &lt;em&gt;beyondblue&lt;/em&gt; website. It is anticipated that the information will also be made available to other youth-orientated sites such as Reach Out and headspace.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Any dissemination strategy needs to be multi-faceted. It is anticipated that dissemination will not only be content based. Rather, access to the advantages of an evidence-based approach, the methodology of creating evidence statements and subsequent recommendations are reforms in the adolescent and youth mental health and counselling field that will accompany dissemination of the 2011 Guidelines. Committee members are committed to providing ongoing training in these areas following the release of the 2011 Guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, there are aspects of the 2011 Guidelines that will be published in the peer-refereed international literature. This reflects the fact that the 2011 Guidelines are underpinned by the most recent meta-analyses of adolescent and youth depression risk factors, prevention and management.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluation of the Usefulness of the Guidelines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;beyondblue&lt;/em&gt; is committed to assessing the impact of the Guidelines once the final Guidelines are released. To address this, &lt;em&gt;beyondblue&lt;/em&gt; has engaged an independent organisation to undertake a baseline survey prior to the approval of the final Guidelines, and 6-month post-dissemination evaluation of the usefulness and uptake of the Guidelines, to test for any changes in clinical practice that occurred after the publication of the Guidelines. The evaluation will not seek to measure health outcomes, as it is considered there would be too many confounding factors to effectively assess and report on this, but will be looking for any change in practice by the target groups 6 months after the release of the Guidelines, which may contribute to improvements in health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The evaluation will follow the process required in the National Health and Medical Research Council publication: &lt;em&gt;A Guide to the Development, Implementation and Evaluation of Clinical Practice Guidelines&lt;/em&gt;, Item 5.1.3 'Evaluation of the guidelines' contribution to changes in clinical practice and health outcomes'. The findings of the evaluation will inform the dissemination and awareness-raising process and may identify areas for providing improved training for key stakeholders, to support the implementation of the recommendations and good practice points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" /></Field><Field FieldID="117" OrdBy="1015" ID="437" Name="Implementation Tools" Type="picklist-many"><FieldValue Value="Chart Documentation/Checklists/Forms" /><FieldValue Value="Clinical Algorithm" /><FieldValue Value="Patient Resources" /><FieldValue Value="Quick Reference Guides/Physician Guides" /><FieldValue Value="Resources" /></Field></Section><Section SecID="439" OrdBy="1100" Name="Institute of Medicine (IOM) National Healthcare Quality Report Categories"><Field FieldID="50" OrdBy="1105" ID="440" Name="IOM Care Need" Type="picklist-many"><FieldValue Value="Getting Better" /><FieldValue Value="Living with Illness" /><FieldValue Value="Staying Healthy" /></Field><Field FieldID="51" OrdBy="1110" ID="441" Name="IOM Domain" Type="picklist-many"><FieldValue Value="Effectiveness" /><FieldValue Value="Patient-centeredness" /></Field></Section><Section SecID="442" OrdBy="1200" Name="Identifying Information and Availability"><Field FieldID="97" OrdBy="1201" ID="392" Name="Bibliographic Source(s)" Type="citation"><FieldValue Value="&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;McDermott B, Baigent M, Chanen A, Graetz B, Hayman N, Newman N, Parikh N, Peirce B, Proimos J, Smalley T, Spence S.
